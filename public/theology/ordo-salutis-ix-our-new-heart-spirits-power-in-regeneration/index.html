    <p class="p1">
  When God saved us from eternity past, His saving work was not finished when Christ lived, died, buried, and rose again, as though there is nothing for him for his people.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You see, every single person born of man since Adam and Eve were born inherently not in connection with God but being apart from God both infinitely and eternally. That separation is because we have no spirit of God because our hearts were not born of God.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Sin has devastating, tearing, ripping-in-half effects. Adam and Eve felt that to a large degree but I don’t think they could possibly fathom what it would be like for their children and their children’s children and for all of the world.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But we see the state of the world today and exponentially more than our forefathers because we have every kind of information at our fingertips.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  School shootings, mass genocide, abortions in the thousands per day: there seems to be no end in depravity. And just when think that our way of life on its own is a little better, we found out that our way of life and privilege is most often at the expense of someone else’s well being. You just have to open your eyes and see.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And even seeing it all has gotten to be too much for most of us. Too much sin, death, disease, depravity, and tragedy for us to handle on top of our own lives.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  That is the inheritance of Adam. That is what we are cursed with.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But can we for sure say “all humans” are born this way? Surely there are some who are born good? There has got to be some hope?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Back in the Old Testament, from the time of Adam, the wickedness of humankind spread throughout the earth.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Genesis 6:5-7 <b>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” </b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  When God spoke of Man, what did he declared? They were greatly wicked and the thoughts of their hearts were only producing evil. And God regretted ever creating mankind, the very image-bearers of Himself.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Before we continue, was Noah a man? So would he have been evil or born good apart from these wicked people?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Genesis 6:8" id="return-note-3570-1" href="#note-3570-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Does the Bible say, “But Noah was a good dude so God decided to spare him.” No, Noah was wicked just like everyone else. But the favor and grace came upon Noah for no other reason because God is good.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You might say, “But what about the next verse?” Let’s read that:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Genesis 6:9 <b>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Now put verses 5 through 9 all together. Look at the order in relation to Noah. Noah was wicked. The thoughts of Noah&#8217;s heart produced evil continuously. God regretted ever creating Noah. But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Because God gave him grace, it was then and only then Noah was declared righteous and blameless in his generation. We know it’s not that Noah was born righteous or even living a righteous life apart from God because Paul quotes a psalm of David in Romans 3:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Romans 3:9–31
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written: </b>
</p>

<p><strong>“None is righteous, no, not one;</strong></p>

<p><strong>no one understands;</strong></p>

<p><strong>no one seeks for God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;</strong></p>

<p><strong>no one does good,</strong></p>

<p><strong>not even one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Their throat is an open grave;</strong></p>

<p><strong>they use their tongues to deceive.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“The venom of asps is under their lips.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Their feet are swift to shed blood;</strong></p>

<p><strong>in their paths are ruin and misery,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the way of peace they have not known.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</strong></p>

<p class="p1">
  But then some would argue that God gave us laws in order for us to be holy. But that is not the purpose of the law. The law of God was simply put in place to get you to see all of your sin and wickedness in the presence of holy and just God. Paul goes on to declare that the law was weak. In other words, the law of God is a mirror for your soul and heart but that’s all it could do. The law of God was powerless and feeble to save your soul.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You know what the real kicker is: with our hearts far from him, we are not actually obeying the laws of God. I know because it is impossible for us to obey God&#8217;s law if our hearts are far from him.
</p>

<p>Romans 8:7–8 <strong>For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">
  Isaiah 64:6<b> We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Because of our wicked hearts, whatever “righteous” deeds we think we are doing are just dirty rags thrown before the feet of God thinking that will be good enough to be saved by Him.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Look at what Jesus says:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Matthew 7:21–23 “<b>Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Wait a minute here. These people were doing what Christ told us to do: prophesy, cast out demons, and do mighty works in his name. Christ would go on to say for us not to rejoice because we can do mighty works and the spirits are subject to us but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Luke 10:20" id="return-note-3570-2" href="#note-3570-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Don’t you see? We cannot know nor love God without taking this wicked heart out and replacing it with heart from God. Nothing good comes out of a heart that was born into sin and has been sinning continuously.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Some theologians teach that faith to believe in God comes from some tiny little deposit of good that was given to all human beings. Well, I would accept that explanation a hundred times over than we are all basically good and can believe and trust in God out of our own strength. Because the latter is simply not happening. Whatever you may think, that faith produces a new heart or it’s a new heart that produces faith, something absolutely good has to start the process of faith because faith (inherently good) does not come from a wicked and depraved heart. The Bible makes that clear.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Choosing God is not like what you choose for breakfast, whom you have chosen to marry or whom you voted for in the last election. For you to believe, trust, love, and choose God, <i>something</i> supernatural has to occur and this is by the work of the Spirit alone by giving us a brand new heart from the Father all made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is only then can we look upon Him with clear eyes, hear him with functioning ears, even taste him with new taste buds to know that he is good or even smell the aroma of Christ on each of us who are made fully alive by God.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  When we have a new heart and His Spirit within us, it is then we can truthfully and fully be obedient to God. First, Christ fulfilled the law for each of us who believe and trust in him. Now, it’s not that we have to obey the laws of God, it is that we <i>get </i>to obey Him.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Don’t believe obedience requires a new heart? See what God says about it.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Ezekiel 36:24–28 <b>I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is only then that God removes us from death and despair; takes the blood of Christ and washes us clean from all unrighteousness <a class="simple-footnote" title="Titus 3:3-7; 2 Corinthians 5:21" id="return-note-3570-3" href="#note-3570-3"><sup>3</sup></a>; give us a brand new soften heart and a new spirit that <i>causes </i>you to walk in His statutes and being careful to obey His rules.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Because of what He has done, we now <i>get</i> to dwell in the house of the Lord forever <a class="simple-footnote" title="Psalm 23:6" id="return-note-3570-4" href="#note-3570-4"><sup>4</sup></a> because we are His people and He is our God!
