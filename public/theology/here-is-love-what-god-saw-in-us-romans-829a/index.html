    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romans 8:29</span> <strong>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many verses that can be used to aptly say what verse twenty-nine so succinctly and definitely says here. I can think of two passages:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 Peter 1:20–21 </span><strong>He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephesians 1:3–14 </span><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to understand God and his love for his people, we can take this little verse, walk through it, and answer the following questions:</span></p>

<p><strong>What did God see in us in that we would be saved to Him?</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have speculated and theorized that foreknowledge of God simply means that God saw into the future and determined God saw those who would believe in him and not believe in him and pick accordingly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We teach our kids the story on how God saved Noah:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesis 6:5–9 </span><strong>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.  These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because of our philosophies born out of the world in which we live today, we surmised that it was Noah, first, that lived a righteous life and it was only then God saved Noah.</span></p>

<p>But does that line up with any story of salvation that you ever heard in the Bible or is Paul correct when he says:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romans 5:8</span> <strong>but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</strong></p>

<p>Notice it doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;while we were really good&#8221; or &#8220;doing our very best, that Christ died for us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back and look at the passage and walk through it step by step:</span></p>

<p><li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>God saw the evilness of humankind</strong> &#8211; The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>God regretted making mankind and it grieved him</strong> &#8211; And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>God had a plan to make everything right-standing with him</strong> &#8211; God So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>And give grace to some</strong> &#8211; But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>And save them</strong> &#8211; … Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.</span>
</li></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider all of the Bible. What makes actual sense? Did Noah act right in order for God to save him? Or if we are to read every single account of salvation in the Bible and since the creation of the world, could we logically, theologically, and reasonably concluded that:</span></p>

<p><li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah was wicked (check)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually (check)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">that God was grieved to the heart because of Noah (check)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">that because of his righteousness and holiness and love and mercy, God saved one family out of many and bestowed unmerited grace upon him (check)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">And because we are only saved by grace alone, it is that Noah was declared righteous and blameless by God and walked with God as he would a friend, (check, check, and check).</span>
</li></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As old dead white guys would say two hundred years ago, let us lay an axe to our pride and to anything that would cause us to boast before the world, each other, and most importantly, God, that we could say, “I am good, save me!” with the same intentionality as one philosopher would say, “God has to save me&#8211;it is what he does”. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should we be audacious before the throne of grace? As the Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits, then yes! But as a child of wrath with no thoughts or convictions about our own sin or zero affections and love towards the Saviour of the world? No! For the child of wrath is declared by the all-knowing God to be unknowable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you might say to me, “This foreknowledge to too much for me to dwell on. How can I comprehend it?” My friend, it is not a belief in foreknowledge of God that would save you but it is faith and belief in the one who lived a life that we could not possibly live, the one who died dying a death that we should have death, resurrected back into life by which we have no power over unto the glory that belongs to God alone. I ask you to comprehend and trust the risen Christ! It is Christ alone who came into the world as a baby and to grow in a man faced every type of temptation just like you or me. But unlike us, he never sinned. For in that glorious work of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are now able to see the Father!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in all of this, I must concede to one answer to the question of “What did God see in us to save us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Genesis 1:1, before time and space began, before the formations of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, before the dirt and mountains and sky and birds, and fish, and animals and anything in all of creation, he looked upon me and saw my wickedness, my pride, my sins, my thoughts, and my intentions, and powerfully, mightedly, gracefully, lovingly, mercifully, righteously, and justly declared,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He is mine! He is in my family! And by the power of My Spirit, I will bring in him into my family because my Son will do everything in order to save him to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of love this? The heart can barely contain the amount. Praise God for his love.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #999999;"><b>Series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Intrigued by the postmodern oft-used answer of “God is love”, by just by digging a little deeper, what I have learned is that people usually mean, “Love is God”. So we then have to ask, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? This series is my attempt to answer that question as theologically and biblically as possible.</span></span></p>
