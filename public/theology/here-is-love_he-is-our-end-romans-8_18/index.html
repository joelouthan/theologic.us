<p>****<strong>Romans 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.</strong></p>

<p>That is why we bother.</p>

<p>If your affections, desires, and wants are places on Christ alone, then there is everything that we have endured and suffered will not compared to seeing His glory. What is glory? Here is my weak, futile, mortal attempt to explain what glory is:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of the goodness of God </b>&#8211; Exodus 33:18-23 Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of the holiness of God</b>&#8211; Leviticus 9:23-24 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of the fullness of God</b> &#8211; Numbers 14:21-23 But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD, none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice, shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>Every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God</b> &#8211; Deuteronomy 5:24 And you said, &#8216;Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211;<i>and</i>&#8211;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Isaiah 55:10–11 “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of his name</b> &#8211; Deuteronomy 28:58 &#8220;If you are not careful to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the LORD your God,
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211;<i>and</i>&#8211;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Revelation 19:11–16<i> </i>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of His power</b> &#8211; 1 Chronicles 29:10-18 Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: &#8220;Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of everything</b> &#8211; Nehemiah 9:6–38<i> </i>“You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you. You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. You found his heart faithful before you, and made with him the covenant to give to his offspring the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite. And you have kept your promise, for you are righteous. “And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea, and performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted arrogantly against our fathers. And you made a name for yourself, as it is to this day. And you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into mighty waters. By a pillar of cloud you led them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night to light for them the way in which they should go. You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right rules and true laws, good statutes and commandments, and you made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them commandments and statutes and a law by Moses your servant. You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and you told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them. “But they and our fathers acted presumptuously and stiffened their neck and did not obey your commandments. They refused to obey and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them, but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them. Even when they had made for themselves a golden calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed great blasphemies, you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them in the way did not depart from them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to light for them the way by which they should go. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst. Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell. “And you gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner. So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. You multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, and you brought them into the land that you had told their fathers to enter and possess. So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. And they captured fortified cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all good things, cisterns already hewn, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness. “Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies. But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies. And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. “Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. Even in their own kingdom, and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress. “Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.

  <b>All of me</b> &#8211; Psalm 3:3-4 But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of my salvation</b> &#8211; Psalm 21:5 His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him. –<i>and</i>&#8211; Psalm 62:7 On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>All of my strength</b> &#8211; Psalm 89:17-18 For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted. For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>Above all of our gods</b> &#8211; Psalm 97:9 For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <b>Above me</b> &#8211; Isaiah 6:1–7 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!”  And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”  Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.
</p>

<p>At best as I can explain it: the glory of God is everything that He is, everything that proceeds from Him and everything back to him. For the latter point, this is where the English language fails me. It is not everything that is due to him but rather He is due everything and will receive everything.  It is easy for the Christian to say, “He is due all the worship” but is that all the worship that we want for him or all the worship that proceeds from us, even if we intentionally or unintentionally worshiped Him? Every single bit of worship is due to God. When we don’t worship God, God will ensure and guarantee that He will get that worship and that glory. Everything that we do either worships God or worships not God.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Philippians 2:8–11<i> </i>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. <b>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</b>
</p>

<p>We will all confess that Jesus Christ is Lord whether you are child of God or a child of His wrath. As much as this might tear up our hearts and soul, that is the glory of God. If you want to debate wrath and salvation, we won’t do that here. However, if the question you are asking is, “How do I know if I am his child of God or a child that sits under his wrath?” then that we can talk about.</p>

<p>There is this: Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”  And Peter said to them, “<strong>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</strong> <a href="#note-2170-1" title="Acts 2:37-38"><sup>1</sup></a>{#return-note-2170-1.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>Then you may ask, “I believe and I trust in Christ who forgives me of my sins? Is that all? What’s going to happen now?” This is where God brings you to his glory. He will begin a work in your heart, soul, and mind. He will work constantly and continuously to conformed to the image of His Son. He will <em>sanctify</em> you. He will grow you. He will nurture you. <a href="#note-2170-2" title="Philippians 1:6; 2 Corinthians 4:15-18"><sup>2</sup></a>{#return-note-2170-2.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>Psalm 73 lays it out like this: “When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart, I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you.  Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.  You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory.” <a href="#note-2170-3" title="Psalm 73:22-24"><sup>3</sup></a>{#return-note-2170-3.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>How can we endure? How can we persevere? The psalmist continues, “Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” <a href="#note-2170-4" title="Psalm 73:25-26"><sup>4</sup></a>{#return-note-2170-4.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>All of my heart is set on Him. Yet, he is all of my strength and my All-in-all forevermore. You see how that works? When we are face to face with our great God and King; when we our hearts have finally, completely, perfectly caught up with His; when we finally get to enter into His joy and our rest, which is when His glory is finally and fully revealed to us. Why does He do that? Because that is love.</p>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong>Series</strong>: Intrigued by the postmodern oft-used answer of “God is love”, by just by digging a little deeper, what I have learned is that people usually mean, “Love is God”. But this begs the question: what is love? To that end, I began writing a series that answers that question.</span></p>
