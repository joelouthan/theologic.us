<p>**I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head,</p>

<p>and you shall bruise his heel.”**</p>

<p>Exodus 3:14</p>

<p><strong>God said to Moses, “I Am Who I Am” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I Am&#8217; has sent me to you.’”</strong></p>

<p>Leviticus 16:21-22</p>

<p><strong>And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.</strong></p>

<p>Numbers 2:1-34</p>

<p>**The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, “The people of Israel shall camp each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers&#8217; houses. They shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side. Those to camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah by their companies, the chief of the people of Judah being Nahshon the son of Amminadab, his company as listed being 74,600. Those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, the chief of the people of Issachar being Nethanel the son of Zuar, his company as listed being 54,400. Then the tribe of Zebulun, the chief of the people of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon, his company as listed being 57,400. All those listed of the camp of Judah, by their companies, were 186,400. They shall set out first on the march.</p></p>

<p>&emsp;“On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their companies, the chief of the people of Reuben being Elizur the son of Shedeur, his company as listed being 46,500. And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, the chief of the people of Simeon being Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, his company as listed being 59,300. Then the tribe of Gad, the chief of the people of Gad being Eliasaph the son of Reuel, his company as listed being 45,650. All those listed of the camp of Reuben, by their companies, were 151,450. They shall set out second.</p>

<p>&emsp;“Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they camp, so shall they set out, each in position, standard by standard.</p>

<p>&emsp;“On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their companies, the chief of the people of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud, his company as listed being 40,500. And next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, the chief of the people of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, his company as listed being 32,200. Then the tribe of Benjamin, the chief of the people of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni, his company as listed being 35,400. All those listed of the camp of Ephraim, by their companies, were 108,100. They shall set out third on the march.</p>

<p>&emsp;“On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their companies, the chief of the people of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, his company as listed being 62,700. And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, the chief of the people of Asher being Pagiel the son of Ochran, his company as listed being 41,500. Then the tribe of Naphtali, the chief of the people of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan, his company as listed being 53,400. All those listed of the camp of Dan were 157,600. They shall set out last, standard by standard.”</p>

<p>&emsp;These are the people of Israel as listed by their fathers&#8217; houses. All those listed in the camps by their companies were 603,550. But the Levites were not listed among the people of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

<p>&emsp;Thus did the people of Israel. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, each one in his clan, according to his fathers&#8217; house.</strong></p>

<p>Deuteronomy 18:15-22</p>

<p><strong>“The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen—just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’ And if you say in your heart, ‘How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?’—when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.</strong></p>

<p>Joshua 5:13-15</p>

<p><strong>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?” And he said, “No; but I am the commander of the army of the Lord. Now I have come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?” And the commander of the LORD&#8217;s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.</strong></p>

<p>Judges 6:14-16</p>

<p><strong>And the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?” And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father&#8217;s house.” And the LORD said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”</strong></p>

<p>Ruth 4:3-6</p>

<p><strong>Then he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. So I thought I would tell you of it and say, ‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.” And he said, “I will redeem it.” Then Boaz said, “The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance.” Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”</strong></p>

<p>1 Samuel 17:48-51</p>

<p>&emsp;**When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p>

<p>&emsp;So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David. Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.**</p>

<p>2 Samuel 7:12-16 <strong>When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”</strong></p>

<p>1 Kings 17:24 <strong>And the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.”</strong></p>

<p>2 Kings 2:9 <strong>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me.”</strong></p>

<p>1 Chronicles 29:10-13</p>

<p><strong>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: “Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.</strong></p>

<p>2 Chronicles 6:9 <strong>Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’</strong></p>

<p>Ezra 6:19-22 <strong>On the fourteenth day of the first month, the returned exiles kept the Passover. For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves. It was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and also by every one who had joined them and separated himself from the uncleanness of the peoples of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel. And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, so that he aided them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</strong></p>

<p>Nehemiah 1:1-11</p>

<p>**The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.</p>

<p>&emsp;Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the citadel, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me, “The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.”</p></p>

<p>&emsp;As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. And I said, “O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father&#8217;s house have sinned. We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples, but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’ They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”</p>

<p>&emsp;Now I was cupbearer to the king.</strong></p>

<p>Esther 7:7-10 <strong>And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king. And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?” As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman&#8217;s face. Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Moreover, the gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman&#8217;s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on that.” So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated.</strong></p>

<p>Job 19:25</p>

<p>**For I know that my Redeemer lives,</p>

<p>&emsp;and at the last he will stand upon the earth.**</p>

<p>Psalms 22</p>

<p>**My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>

<p>&emsp;Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?</p>

<p>O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,</p>

<p>&emsp;and by night, but I find no rest.</p>

<p>Yet you are holy,</p>

<p>&emsp;enthroned on the praises of Israel.</p>

<p>In you our fathers trusted;</p>

<p>&emsp;they trusted, and you delivered them.</p>

<p>To you they cried and were rescued;</p>

<p>&emsp;in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>

<p>But I am a worm and not a man,</p>

<p>&emsp;scorned by mankind and despised by the people.</p>

<p>All who see me mock me;</p>

<p>&emsp;they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;</p>

<p>“He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him;</p>

<p>&emsp;let him rescue him, for he delights in him!”</p>

<p>Yet you are he who took me from the womb;</p>

<p>&emsp;you made me trust you at my mother&#8217;s breasts.</p>

<p>On you was I cast from my birth,</p>

<p>&emsp;and from my mother&#8217;s womb you have been my God.</p>

<p>Be not far from me,</p>

<p>&emsp;for trouble is near,</p>

<p>&emsp;and there is none to help.</p>

<p>Many bulls encompass me;</p>

<p>&emsp;strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</p>

<p>they open wide their mouths at me,</p>

<p>&emsp;like a ravening and roaring lion.</p>

<p>I am poured out like water,</p>

<p>&emsp;and all my bones are out of joint;</p>

<p>my heart is like wax;</p>

<p>&emsp;it is melted within my breast;</p>

<p>my strength is dried up like a potsherd,</p>

<p>&emsp;and my tongue sticks to my jaws;</p>

<p>&emsp;you lay me in the dust of death.</p>

<p>For dogs encompass me;</p>

<p>&emsp;a company of evildoers encircles me;</p>

<p>they have pierced my hands and feet—</p>

<p>I can count all my bones—</p>

<p>they stare and gloat over me;</p>

<p>they divide my garments among them,</p>

<p>&emsp;and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>

<p>But you, O LORD, do not be far off!</p>

<p>&emsp;O you my help, come quickly to my aid!</p>

<p>Deliver my soul from the sword,</p>

<p>&emsp;my precious life from the power of the dog!</p>

<p>&emsp;Save me from the mouth of the lion!</p>

<p>You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!</p>

<p>I will tell of your name to my brothers;</p>

<p>&emsp;in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:</p>

<p>You who fear the LORD, praise him!</p>

<p>&emsp;All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him,</p>

<p>&emsp;and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!</p>

<p>For he has not despised or abhorred</p>

<p>&emsp;the affliction of the afflicted,</p>

<p>and he has not hidden his face from him,</p>

<p>&emsp;but has heard, when he cried to him.</p>

<p>From you comes my praise in the great congregation;</p>

<p>&emsp;my vows I will perform before those who fear him.</p>

<p>The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;</p>

<p>&emsp;those who seek him shall praise the LORD!</p>

<p>&emsp;May your hearts live forever!</p>

<p>All the ends of the earth shall remember</p>

<p>&emsp;and turn to the LORD,</p>

<p>and all the families of the nations</p>

<p>&emsp;shall worship before you.</p>

<p>For kingship belongs to the LORD,</p>

<p>&emsp;and he rules over the nations.</p>

<p>All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;</p>

<p>&emsp;before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,</p>

<p>&emsp;even the one who could not keep himself alive.</p>

<p>Posterity shall serve him;</p>

<p>&emsp;it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;</p>

<p>they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn,</p>

<p>&emsp;that he has done it.**</p>

<p>Proverbs 30:4-5</p>

<p>**Who has ascended to heaven and come down?</p>

<p>&emsp;Who has gathered the wind in his fists?</p>

<p>&emsp;Who has established all the ends of the earth?</p>

<p>What is his name, and what is his son&#8217;s name?</p>

<p>&emsp;Surely you know!</p>

<p>Every word of God proves true;</p>

<p>&emsp;he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.**</p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 3:11</p>

<p>Isaiah 53</p>

<p>**Who has believed what he has heard from us?</p>

<p>&emsp;And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</p>

<p>For he grew up before him like a young plant,</p>

<p>&emsp;and like a root out of dry ground;</p>

<p>he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,</p>

<p>&emsp;and no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

<p>He was despised and rejected by men;</p>

<p>&emsp;a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;</p>

<p>and as one from whom men hide their faces</p>

<p>&emsp;he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>

<p>Surely he has borne our griefs</p>

<p>&emsp;and carried our sorrows;</p>

<p>yet we esteemed him stricken,</p>

<p>&emsp;smitten by God, and afflicted.</p>

<p>But he was pierced for our transgressions;</p>

<p>&emsp;he was crushed for our iniquities;</p>

<p>upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,</p>

<p>&emsp;and with his wounds we are healed.</p>

<p>All we like sheep have gone astray;</p>

<p>&emsp;we have turned—every one—to his own way;</p>

<p>and the LORD has laid on him</p>

<p>&emsp;the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,</p>

<p>&emsp;yet he opened not his mouth;</p>

<p>like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,</p>

<p>&emsp;and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,</p>

<p>&emsp;so he opened not his mouth.</p>

<p>By oppression and judgment he was taken away;</p>

<p>&emsp;and as for his generation, who considered</p>

<p>that he was cut off out of the land of the living,</p>

<p>&emsp;stricken for the transgression of my people?</p>

<p>And they made his grave with the wicked</p>

<p>&emsp;and with a rich man in his death,</p>

<p>although he had done no violence,</p>

<p>&emsp;and there was no deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p>Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;</p>

<p>&emsp;he has put him to grief;</p>

<p>when his soul makes an offering for guilt,</p>

<p>&emsp;he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;</p>

<p>the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;</p>

<p>by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,</p>

<p>&emsp;make many to be accounted righteous,</p>

<p>&emsp;and he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

<p>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,</p>

<p>&emsp;and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</p>

<p>because he poured out his soul to death</p>

<p>&emsp;and was numbered with the transgressors;</p>

<p>yet he bore the sin of many,</p>

<p>&emsp;and makes intercession for the transgressors.**</p>

<p>Jeremiah 23:1-4</p>

<p><strong>“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.</strong></p>

<p>Lamentations 3:21-24</p>

<p>**But this I call to mind,</p>

<p>&emsp;“therefore I will hope in him.”**</p>

<p>Ezekiel 36-37</p>

<p>&emsp;**“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations. It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</p>

<p>&emsp;“Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt. And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by. And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’ Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.</p>

<p>&emsp;“Thus says the Lord GOD: This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their people like a flock. Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”</p></p>

<p>&emsp;The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”</p>

<p>&emsp;So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</p>

<p>&emsp;Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.’ Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.”</p>

<p>&emsp;The word of the LORD came to me: “Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him’; then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.’ And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. And when your people say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean by these?’ say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>

<p>&emsp;“My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes. They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children&#8217;s children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore. My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.”</strong></p>

<p>Daniel 7:9-14</p>

<p>Their appearance is like the appearance of horses,</p>

<p><strong>She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”</strong></p>

<p>Mark 1:22</p>

<p><strong>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</strong></p>

<p>Luke 24:27</p>

<p><strong>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</strong></p>

<p>John 1:1-18</p>

<p>&emsp;**In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>

<p>&emsp;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>

<p>&emsp;The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

<p>&emsp;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father&#8217;s side, he has made him known.**</p>

For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:</p>

<p>&emsp;“‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares,</p>

<p>&emsp;that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,</p>

<p>&emsp;and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and your young men shall see visions,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and your old men shall dream dreams;</p>

<p>&emsp;even on my male servants and female servants</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p>

<p>&emsp;And I will show wonders in the heavens above</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and signs on the earth below,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;</p>

<p>&emsp;the sun shall be turned to darkness</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and the moon to blood,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.</p>

<p>&emsp;And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p>

<p>&emsp;“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him,</p>

<p>&emsp;“‘I saw the Lord always before me,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;</p>

<p>&emsp;therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;my flesh also will dwell in hope.</p>

<p>&emsp;For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;or let your Holy One see corruption.</p>

<p>&emsp;You have made known to me the paths of life;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’</p>

<p>&emsp;“Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p>

<p>&emsp;“‘The Lord said to my Lord,</p>

<p>&emsp;“Sit at my right hand,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</p>

<p>&emsp;Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”</p>

<p>&emsp;Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.**</p>

<p>Romans 7:24-8:39</p>

<p>&emsp;**Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p>

<p>&emsp;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God&#8217;s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>

<p>&emsp;You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>

<p>&emsp;So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>

<p>&emsp;For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p>

<p>&emsp;Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>

<p>&emsp;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God&#8217;s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,</p>

<p>&emsp;“For your sake we are being killed all the day long;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”</p>

<p>&emsp;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.**</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:1-11</p>

<p>&emsp;**Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.</p>

<p>&emsp;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.**</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 5:11-21</p>

<p>&emsp;**&emsp;Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.**</p>

<p>Galatians 3:10-18</p>

<p>&emsp;**For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”—so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p>

<p>&emsp;To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.**</p>

<p>Ephesians 2:1-10</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</strong></p>

<p>Philippians 2:5-11</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</strong></p>

<p>Colossians 1:15-20</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.</strong></p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 4:16-18</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.</strong></p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 1:5-12</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>

<p>1 Timothy 1:12-17</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>&emsp;</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3:16-17</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</strong></p>

<p>Titus 3:3-7</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</strong></p>

<p>Philemon 1:20</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</strong></p>

<p>Hebrews 1</p>

<p>&emsp;**Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>

<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>

<p>&emsp;“You are my Son,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;today I have begotten you”?</p>

<p>Or again,</p>

<p>&emsp;“I will be to him a father,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and he shall be to me a son”?</p>

<p>&emsp;And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,</p>

<p>&emsp;“Let all God&#8217;s angels worship him.”</p>

<p>&emsp;Of the angels he says,</p>

<p>&emsp;“He makes his angels winds,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and his ministers a flame of fire.”</p>

<p>But of the Son he says,</p>

<p>&emsp;“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>

<p>&emsp;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;</p>

<p>&emsp;therefore God, your God, has anointed you</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>&emsp;“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and the heavens are the work of your hands;</p>

<p>&emsp;they will perish, but you remain;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;they will all wear out like a garment,</p>

<p>&emsp;like a robe you will roll them up,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;like a garment they will be changed.</p>

<p>&emsp;But you are the same,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;and your years will have no end.”</p>

<p>And to which of the angels has he ever said,</p>

<p>&emsp;“Sit at my right hand</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?</p>

<p>Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?**</p>

<p>James 5:7-11</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains. You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door. As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</strong></p>

<p>1 Peter 1:3-12</p>

<p>&emsp;**Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God&#8217;s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</p>

<p>&emsp;Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.**</p>

<p>2 Peter 1:3-11</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</strong></p>

<p>1 John 2:1-6</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.</strong></p>

<p>2 John 3</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father&#8217;s Son, in truth and love.</strong></p>

<p>3 John 11</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.</strong></p>

<p>Jude 20-21</p>

<p>&emsp;<strong>But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.</strong></p>

<p>Revelation 22:13</p>

<p><strong>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</strong></p>

<p>Revelation 22:20</p>

<p><strong>He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</strong></p>
