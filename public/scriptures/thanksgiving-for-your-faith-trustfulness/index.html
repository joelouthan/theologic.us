    <p>Genesis 24:27</p>

<p>and said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master’s kinsmen.”</p>

<p>Genesis 32:10</p>

<p>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.</p>

<p>Exodus 34:6-9</p>

<p>The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation.”</p>

<p>And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped. And he said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”</p>

<p>Numbers 23:19</p>

<p>God is not man, that he should lie,</p>

<p>or a son of man, that he should change his mind.</p>

<p>Has he said, and will he not do it?</p>

<p>Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</p>

<p>Nehemiah 9:33-38</p>

<p>Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. Even in their own kingdom, and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress.</p>

<p>“Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.</p>

<p>Psalm 25:10-11</p>

<p>All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness,</p>

<p>for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.</p>

<p>For your name’s sake, O LORD,</p>

<p>pardon my guilt, for it is great.</p>

<p>Psalm 26:3</p>

<p>For your steadfast love is before my eyes,</p>

<p>and I walk in your faithfulness.</p>

<p>Psalm 31:3-5</p>

<p>or you are my rock and my fortress;</p>

<p>and for your name’s sake you lead me and guide me;</p>

<p>you take me out of the net they have hidden for me,</p>

<p>for you are my refuge.</p>

<p>Into your hand I commit my spirit;</p>

<p>you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.</p>

<p>Psalm 36:5-6</p>

<p>Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens,</p>

<p>your faithfulness to the clouds.</p>

<p>Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;</p>

<p>your judgments are like the great deep;</p>

<p>man and beast you save, O LORD.</p>

<p>Psalm 40:11</p>

<p>As for you, O LORD, you will not restrain</p>

<p>your mercy from me;</p>

<p>your steadfast love and your faithfulness will</p>

<p>ever preserve me!</p>

<p>Psalm 61:7-8</p>

<p>May he be enthroned forever before God;</p>

<p>appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!</p>

<p>So will I ever sing praises to your name,</p>

<p>as I perform my vows day after day.</p>

<p>Psalm 69:13</p>

<p>But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD.</p>

<p>At an acceptable time, O God,</p>

<p>in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.</p>

<p>Psalm 85:10-11</p>

<p>Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;</p>

<p>righteousness and peace kiss each other.</p>

<p>Faithfulness springs up from the ground,</p>

<p>and righteousness looks down from the sky.</p>

<p>Psalm 86:15-17</p>

<p>But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,</p>

<p>slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Turn to me and be gracious to me;</p>

<p>give your strength to your servant,</p>

<p>and save the son of your maidservant.</p>

<p>Show me a sign of your favor,</p>

<p>that those who hate me may see and be put to shame</p>

<p>because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</p>

<p>Psalm 89:1-52</p>

<p>I will sing of the steadfast love of the Lord, forever;</p>

<p>with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</p>

<p>For I said, “Steadfast love will be built up forever;</p>

<p>in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness.”</p>

<p>You have said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one;</p>

<p>I have sworn to David my servant:</p>

<p>‘I will establish your offspring forever,</p>

<p>and build your throne for all generations.’” Selah</p>

<p>Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,</p>

<p>your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!</p>

<p>For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?</p>

<p>Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord,</p>

<p>a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones,</p>

<p>and awesome above all who are around him?</p>

<p>O Lord God of hosts,</p>

<p>who is mighty as you are, O Lord,</p>

<p>with your faithfulness all around you?</p>

<p>You rule the raging of the sea;</p>

<p>when its waves rise, you still them.</p>

<p>You crushed Rahab like a carcass;</p>

<p>you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</p>

<p>The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours;</p>

<p>the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.</p>

<p>The north and the south, you have created them;</p>

<p>Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.</p>

<p>You have a mighty arm;</p>

<p>strong is your hand, high your right hand.</p>

<p>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;</p>

<p>steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.</p>

<p>Blessed are the people who know the festal shout,</p>

<p>who walk, O Lord, in the light of your face,</p>

<p>who exult in your name all the day</p>

<p>and in your righteousness are exalted.</p>

<p>For you are the glory of their strength;</p>

<p>by your favor our horn is exalted.</p>

<p>For our shield belongs to the Lord,</p>

<p>our king to the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said:</p>

<p>“I have granted help to one who is mighty;</p>

<p>I have exalted one chosen from the people.</p>

<p>I have found David, my servant;</p>

<p>with my holy oil I have anointed him,</p>

<p>so that my hand shall be established with him;</p>

<p>my arm also shall strengthen him.</p>

<p>The enemy shall not outwit him;</p>

<p>the wicked shall not humble him.</p>

<p>I will crush his foes before him</p>

<p>and strike down those who hate him.</p>

<p>My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him,</p>

<p>and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>

<p>I will set his hand on the sea</p>

<p>and his right hand on the rivers.</p>

<p>He shall cry to me, ‘You are my Father,</p>

<p>my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’</p>

<p>And I will make him the firstborn,</p>

<p>the highest of the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>My steadfast love I will keep for him forever,</p>

<p>and my covenant will stand firm for him.</p>

<p>I will establish his offspring forever</p>

<p>and his throne as the days of the heavens.</p>

<p>If his children forsake my law</p>

<p>and do not walk according to my rules,</p>

<p>if they violate my statutes</p>

<p>and do not keep my commandments,</p>

<p>then I will punish their transgression with the rod</p>

<p>and their iniquity with stripes,</p>

<p>but I will not remove from him my steadfast love</p>

<p>or be false to my faithfulness.</p>

<p>I will not violate my covenant</p>

<p>or alter the word that went forth from my lips.</p>

<p>Once for all I have sworn by my holiness;</p>

<p>I will not lie to David.</p>

<p>His offspring shall endure forever,</p>

<p>his throne as long as the sun before me.</p>

<p>Like the moon it shall be established forever,</p>

<p>a faithful witness in the skies.” Selah</p>

<p>But now you have cast off and rejected;</p>

<p>you are full of wrath against your anointed.</p>

<p>You have renounced the covenant with your servant;</p>

<p>you have defiled his crown in the dust.</p>

<p>You have breached all his walls;</p>

<p>you have laid his strongholds in ruins.</p>

<p>All who pass by plunder him;</p>

<p>he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</p>

<p>You have exalted the right hand of his foes;</p>

<p>you have made all his enemies rejoice.</p>

<p>You have also turned back the edge of his sword,</p>

<p>and you have not made him stand in battle.</p>

<p>You have made his splendor to cease</p>

<p>and cast his throne to the ground.</p>

<p>You have cut short the days of his youth;</p>

<p>you have covered him with shame. Selah</p>

<p>How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?</p>

<p>How long will your wrath burn like fire?</p>

<p>Remember how short my time is!</p>

<p>For what vanity you have created all the children of man!</p>

<p>What man can live and never see death?</p>

<p>Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah</p>

<p>Lord, where is your steadfast love of old,</p>

<p>which by your faithfulness you swore to David?</p>

<p>Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked,</p>

<p>and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,</p>

<p>with which your enemies mock, O Lord,</p>

<p>with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.</p>

<p>Blessed be the Lord forever!</p>

<p>Amen and Amen.</p>

<p>Psalm 92:1-4</p>

<p>It is good to give thanks to the Lord,</p>

<p>to sing praises to your name, O Most High;</p>

<p>to declare your steadfast love in the morning,</p>

<p>and your faithfulness by night,</p>

<p>to the music of the lute and the harp,</p>

<p>to the melody of the lyre.</p>

<p>For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work;</p>

<p>at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</p>

<p>Psalm 115:1-3</p>

<p>Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory,</p>

<p>for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!</p>

<p>Why should the nations say,</p>

<p>“Where is their God?”</p>

<p>Our God is in the heavens;</p>

<p>he does all that he pleases.</p>

<p>Psalm 117:1-2</p>

<p>Praise the Lord, all nations!</p>

<p>Extol him, all peoples!</p>

<p>For great is his steadfast love toward us,</p>

<p>and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Psalm 138:1-3</p>

<p>I give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart;</p>

<p>before the gods I sing your praise;</p>

<p>I bow down toward your holy temple</p>

<p>and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness,</p>

<p>for you have exalted above all things</p>

<p>your name and your word.</p>

<p>On the day I called, you answered me;</p>

<p>my strength of soul you increased.</p>

<p>Psalm 143:1</p>

<p>Hear my prayer, O LORD;</p>

<p>give ear to my pleas for mercy!</p>

<p>In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness!</p>

<p>Isaiah 38:16-20</p>

<p>O Lord, by these things men live,</p>

<p>and in all these is the life of my spirit.</p>

<p>Oh restore me to health and make me live!</p>

<p>Behold, it was for my welfare</p>

<p>that I had great bitterness;</p>

<p>but in love you have delivered my life</p>

<p>from the pit of destruction,</p>

<p>for you have cast all my sins</p>

<p>behind your back.</p>

<p>For Sheol does not thank you;</p>

<p>death does not praise you;</p>

<p>those who go down to the pit do not hope</p>

<p>for your faithfulness.</p>

<p>The living, the living, he thanks you,</p>

<p>as I do this day;</p>

<p>the father makes known to the children</p>

<p>your faithfulness.</p>

<p>The Lord will save me,</p>

<p>and we will play my music on stringed instruments</p>

<p>all the days of our lives,</p>

<p>at the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>Isaiah 49:7</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord,</p>

<p>the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,</p>

<p>to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation,</p>

<p>the servant of rulers:</p>

<p>“Kings shall see and arise;</p>

<p>princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;</p>

<p>because of the Lord, who is faithful,</p>

<p>the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</p>

<p>Lamentations 3:22-23</p>

<p>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;</p>

<p>his mercies never come to an end;</p>

<p>they are new every morning;</p>

<p>great is your faithfulness.</p>

<p>Hosea 2:18-23</p>

<p>And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety. And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the Lord.</p>

<p>“And in that day I will answer, declares the Lord,</p>

<p>I will answer the heavens,</p>

<p>and they shall answer the earth,</p>

<p>and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil,</p>

<p>and they shall answer Jezreel,</p>

<p>and I will sow her for myself in the land.</p>

<p>And I will have mercy on No Mercy,</p>

<p>and I will say to Not My People, ‘You are my people’;</p>

<p>and he shall say, ‘You are my God.’”</p>

<p>Micah 7:20</p>

<p>You will show faithfulness to Jacob</p>

<p>and steadfast love to Abraham,</p>

<p>as you have sworn to our fathers</p>

<p>from the days of old.</p>

<p>Habakkuk 2:4</p>

<p>“Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,</p>

<p>but the righteous shall live by his faith.</p>

<p>Zechariah 8:7-8</p>

<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts: behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.”</p>

<p>Romans 1:16-17</p>

<p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</p>

<p>Romans 3:21-31</p>

<p>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</p>

<p>Romans 4:5</p>

<p>And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,</p>

<p>Romans 8:28-30</p>

<p>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>

<p>Romans 10:17</p>

<p>So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:9</p>

<p>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 2:1-5</p>

<p>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:14</p>

<p>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:17-19</p>

<p>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>

<p>Galatians 2:20</p>

<p>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>

<p>Galatians 3:2</p>

<p>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?</p>

<p>Galatians 3:7-9</p>

<p>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p>

<p>Galatians 3:11-14</p>

<p>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”— so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p>

<p>Galatians 3:23-29</p>

<p>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.</p>

<p>Galatians 5:22-23</p>

<p>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</p>

<p>Ephesians 2:8-9</p>

<p>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.</p>

<p>Ephesians 3:14-21</p>

<p>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>

<p>Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Ephesians 4:4-8</p>

<p>There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says,</p>

<p>“When he ascended on high he led a host of captives,</p>

<p>and he gave gifts to men.”</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:16</p>

<p>In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one;</p>

<p>Philippians 1:6</p>

<p>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 5:24</p>

<p>He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 3:3-5</p>

<p>But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one. And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command. May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1 Timothy 1:12-17</p>

<p>I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 2:11-13</p>

<p>The saying is trustworthy, for:</p>

<p>If we have died with him, we will also live with him;</p>

<p>if we endure, we will also reign with him;</p>

<p>if we deny him, he also will deny us;</p>

<p>if we are faithless, he remains faithful—</p>

<p>for he cannot deny himself.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:14-18</p>

<p>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p>

<p>Hebrews 3:5-6</p>

<p>Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, but Christ is faithful over God’s house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.</p>

<p>Hebrews 10:23</p>

<p>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.</p>

<p>Hebrews 10:38</p>

<p>but my righteous one shall live by faith,</p>

<p>and if he shrinks back,</p>

<p>my soul has no pleasure in him.”</p>

<p>Hebrews 12:1-2</p>

<p>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>

<p>1 John 1:9</p>

<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>

<p>Revelation 1:4-8</p>

<p>Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.</p>

<p>To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.</p>

<p>“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”</p>

<p>Revelation 17:14</p>

<p>They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.”</p>

<p>Revelation 19:11</p>

<p>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</p>
