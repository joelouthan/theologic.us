    <p>Numbers 23:19</p>

<p>God is not man, that he should lie,</p>

<p>or a son of man, that he should change his mind.</p>

<p>Has he said, and will he not do it?</p>

<p>Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 5:29</p>

<p>Oh that they had such a mind as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever!</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 30:1-3</p>

<p>“And when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you, and return to the LORD your God, you and your children, and obey his voice in all that I command you today, with all your heart and with all your soul, then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, and he will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.</p>

<p>1 Samuel 2:35</p>

<p>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever.</p>

<p>1 Kings 3:9-14; 4:29-34</p>

<p>Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?”</p>

<p>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. And God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”</p>

<p>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all other men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish. And people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p>

<p>1 Kings 8:46-53</p>

<p>“If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near, yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,’ if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive,</p>

<p>and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name, then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them (for they are your people, and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace). Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to you. For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage, as you declared through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.”</p>

<p>1 Chronicles 28:9</p>

<p>“And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</p>

<p>Ezra 9:1-15</p>

<p>After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.” As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled. Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice. And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the Lord my God, saying:</p>

<p>“O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens. From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt.</p>

<p>And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today. But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery. For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.’</p>

<p>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this, shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? O Lord, the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this.”</p>

<p>Job 38:36</p>

<p>Who has put wisdom in the inward parts</p>

<p>or given understanding to the mind?</p>

<p>Job 42:1-6</p>

<p>Then Job answered the Lord and said:</p>

<p>“I know that you can do all things,</p>

<p>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</p>

<p>‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’</p>

<p>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,</p>

<p>things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</p>

<p>‘Hear, and I will speak;</p>

<p>I will question you, and you make it known to me.’</p>

<p>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,</p>

<p>but now my eye sees you;</p>

<p>therefore I despise myself,</p>

<p>and repent in dust and ashes.”</p>

<p>Psalm 7:8-11</p>

<p>The Lord judges the peoples;</p>

<p>judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness</p>

<p>and according to the integrity that is in me.</p>

<p>Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end,</p>

<p>and may you establish the righteous—</p>

<p>you who test the minds and hearts,</p>

<p>O righteous God!</p>

<p>My shield is with God,</p>

<p>who saves the upright in heart.</p>

<p>God is a righteous judge,</p>

<p>and a God who feels indignation every day.</p>

<p>Psalm 8:3-4</p>

<p>When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,</p>

<p>the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</p>

<p>what is man that you are mindful of him,</p>

<p>and the son of man that you care for him?</p>

<p>Psalm 26:2-3</p>

<p>Prove me, O LORD, and try me;</p>

<p>test my heart and my mind.</p>

<p>For your steadfast love is before my eyes,</p>

<p>and I walk in your faithfulness.</p>

<p>Psalm 51:10</p>

<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</p>

<p>Proverbs 19:21</p>

<p>Many are the plans in the mind of a man,</p>

<p>but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.</p>

<p>Isaiah 1:27-31</p>

<p>Zion shall be redeemed by justice,</p>

<p>and those in her who repent, by righteousness.</p>

<p>But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,</p>

<p>and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>

<p>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks</p>

<p>that you desired;</p>

<p>and you shall blush for the gardens</p>

<p>that you have chosen.</p>

<p>For you shall be like an oak</p>

<p>whose leaf withers,</p>

<p>and like a garden without water.</p>

<p>And the strong shall become tinder,</p>

<p>and his work a spark,</p>

<p>and both of them shall burn together,</p>

<p>with none to quench them.</p>

<p>Isaiah 26:3</p>

<p>You keep him in perfect peace</p>

<p>whose mind is stayed on you,</p>

<p>because he trusts in you.</p>

<p>Isaiah 46:8-13</p>

<p>“Remember this and stand firm,</p>

<p>recall it to mind, you transgressors,</p>

<p>remember the former things of old;</p>

<p>for I am God, and there is no other;</p>

<p>I am God, and there is none like me,</p>

<p>declaring the end from the beginning</p>

<p>and from ancient times things not yet done,</p>

<p>saying, ‘My counsel shall stand,</p>

<p>and I will accomplish all my purpose,’</p>

<p>calling a bird of prey from the east,</p>

<p>the man of my counsel from a far country.</p>

<p>I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;</p>

<p>I have purposed, and I will do it.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,</p>

<p>you who are far from righteousness:</p>

<p>I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off,</p>

<p>and my salvation will not delay;</p>

<p>I will put salvation in Zion,</p>

<p>for Israel my glory.”</p>

<p>Jeremiah 11:20</p>

<p>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously,</p>

<p>who tests the heart and the mind,</p>

<p>let me see your vengeance upon them,</p>

<p>for to you have I committed my cause.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 17:10</p>

<p>“I the LORD search the heart</p>

<p>and test the mind,</p>

<p>to give every man according to his ways,</p>

<p>according to the fruit of his deeds.”</p>

<p>Lamentations 3:20-24</p>

<p>My soul continually remembers it</p>

<p>and is bowed down within me.</p>

<p>But this I call to mind,</p>

<p>and therefore I have hope:</p>

<p>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;</p>

<p>his mercies never come to an end;</p>

<p>they are new every morning;</p>

<p>great is your faithfulness.</p>

<p>“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,</p>

<p>“therefore I will hope in him.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel 11:5</p>

<p>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 14:6-11</p>

<p>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations. For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself. And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD. And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. And they shall bear their punishment—the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike— that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel 18:30-32</p>

<p>“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin. Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn, and live.”</p>

<p>Daniel 2:30</p>

<p>But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.</p>

<p>Proverbs 25:2</p>

<p>It is the glory of God to conceal things,</p>

<p>but the glory of kings is to search things out.</p>

<p>Matthew 3:2-3</p>

<p>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” [3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</p>

<p>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:</p>

<p>‘Prepare the way of the Lord;</p>

<p>make his paths straight.’”</p>

<p>Matthew 3:7-12</p>

<p>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>

<p>“I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”</p>

<p>Matthew 4:17</p>

<p>From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p>

<p>Matthew 22:37-40</p>

<p>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”</p>

<p>Mark 1:14-15</p>

<p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”</p>

<p>Luke 5:31-32</p>

<p>And Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</p>

<p>Luke 15:7</p>

<p>Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.</p>

<p>Luke 15:10</p>

<p>Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</p>

<p>Luke 24:44-49</p>

<p>Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”</p>

<p>John 4:21-26</p>

<p>Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”</p>

<p>John 14:15-17</p>

<p>If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.</p>

<p>John 15:7</p>

<p>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</p>

<p>John 16:13-15</p>

<p>When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</p>

<p>Acts 2:14-41</p>

<p>But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:</p>

<p>“‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares,</p>

<p>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,</p>

<p>and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</p>

<p>and your young men shall see visions,</p>

<p>and your old men shall dream dreams;</p>

<p>even on my male servants and female servants</p>

<p>in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p>

<p>And I will show wonders in the heavens above</p>

<p>and signs on the earth below,</p>

<p>blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;</p>

<p>the sun shall be turned to darkness</p>

<p>and the moon to blood,</p>

<p>before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p>

<p>“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him,</p>

<p>“‘I saw the Lord always before me,</p>

<p>for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;</p>

<p>therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;</p>

<p>my flesh also will dwell in hope.</p>

<p>For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,</p>

<p>or let your Holy One see corruption.</p>

<p>You have made known to me the paths of life;</p>

<p>you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’</p>

<p>“Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p>

<p>“‘The Lord said to my Lord,</p>

<p>Sit at my right hand,</p>

<p>until I make your enemies your footstool.’</p>

<p>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”</p>

<p>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p>

<p>Acts 3:11-26</p>

<p>While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s. And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?</p>

<p>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.</p>

<p>“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.</p>

<p>You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.’ And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.”</p>

<p>Acts 26:24-29</p>

<p>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.” But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” And Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?” And Paul said, “Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am—except for these chains.”</p>

<p>Romans 7:7-8:17</p>

<p>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.” But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</p>

<p>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p>

<p>For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p>

<p>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p>

<p>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</p>

<p>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>

<p>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>

<p>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”</p>

<p>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>

<p>Romans 8:27</p>

<p>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Romans 9:8-10</p>

<p>But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</p>

<p>Romans 12:1-2</p>

<p>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 2:1-16</p>

<p>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</p>

<p>Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written,</p>

<p>“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,</p>

<p>nor the heart of man imagined,</p>

<p>what God has prepared for those who love him”—</p>

<p>these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.</p>

<p>The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 5:11-21</p>

<p>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p>

<p>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.</p>

<p>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 7:10</p>

<p>For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 10:1-6</p>

<p>I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!—</p>

<p>I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh. For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</p>

<p>Ephesians 4:11-32</p>

<p>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>

<p>Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. But that is not the way you learned Christ!— assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.</p>

<p>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil. Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.</p>

<p>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.</p>

<p>Philippians 1:27-2:11</p>

<p>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</p>

<p>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.</p>

<p>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colossians 3:2-4</p>

<p>Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 2:24-26</p>

<p>And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 4:5</p>

<p>As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</p>

<p>Hebrews 6:1-3</p>

<p>Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And this we will do if God permits.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1 Peter 3:8-12</p>

<p>Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life</p>

<p>and see good days,</p>

<p>let him keep his tongue from evil</p>

<p>and his lips from speaking deceit;</p>

<p>let him turn away from evil and do good;</p>

<p>let him seek peace and pursue it.</p>

<p>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</p>

<p>and his ears are open to their prayer.</p>

<p>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p>2 Peter 3:1-9</p>

<p>This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder, that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles, knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.</p>

<p>But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.</p>

<p>1 John 1:9</p>

<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>

<p>Isaiah 65:17-18</p>

<p>“For behold, I create new heavens</p>

<p>and a new earth,</p>

<p>and the former things shall not be remembered</p>

<p>or come into mind.</p>

<p>But be glad and rejoice forever</p>

<p>in that which I create;</p>

<p>for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy,</p>

<p>and her people to be a gladness.</p>

<p>Psalm 37:4</p>

<p>Delight yourself in the Lord,</p>

<p>and he will give you the desires of your heart.</p>
