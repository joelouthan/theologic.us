    <p>Isaiah 64:6</p>

<p>We have all become like one who is unclean,</p>

<p>and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.</p>

<p>We all fade like a leaf,</p>

<p>and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</p>

<p>Genesis 3:21</p>

<p>And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.</p>

<p>Genesis 6:5-9</p>

<p>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”</p>

<p>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.</p>

<p>1 Chronicles 29:17-18</p>

<p>I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.</p>

<p>Job 29:14</p>

<p>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;</p>

<p>my justice was like a robe and a turban.</p>

<p>Psalm 4:1</p>

<p>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!</p>

<p>You have given me relief when I was in distress.</p>

<p>Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!</p>

<p>Psalm 23:3</p>

<p>He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.</p>

<p>Psalm 55:22-23</p>

<p>Cast your burden on the LORD,</p>

<p>and he will sustain you;</p>

<p>he will never permit</p>

<p>the righteous to be moved.</p>

<p>But you, O God, will cast them down</p>

<p>into the pit of destruction;</p>

<p>men of blood and treachery</p>

<p>shall not live out half their days.</p>

<p>But I will trust in you.</p>

<p>Psalm 71:15-21</p>

<p>My mouth will tell of your righteous acts,</p>

<p>of your deeds of salvation all the day,</p>

<p>for their number is past my knowledge.</p>

<p>With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come;</p>

<p>I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone.</p>

<p>O God, from my youth you have taught me,</p>

<p>and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.</p>

<p>So even to old age and gray hairs,</p>

<p>O God, do not forsake me,</p>

<p>until I proclaim your might to another generation,</p>

<p>your power to all those to come.</p>

<p>Your righteousness, O God,</p>

<p>reaches the high heavens.</p>

<p>You who have done great things,</p>

<p>O God, who is like you?</p>

<p>You who have made me see many troubles and calamities</p>

<p>will revive me again;</p>

<p>from the depths of the earth</p>

<p>you will bring me up again.</p>

<p>You will increase my greatness</p>

<p>and comfort me again.</p>

<p>Psalm 85:7-10</p>

<p>Show us your steadfast love, O Lord,</p>

<p>and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p>Let me hear what God the Lord will speak,</p>

<p>for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints;</p>

<p>but let them not turn back to folly.</p>

<p>Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,</p>

<p>that glory may dwell in our land.</p>

<p>Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;</p>

<p>righteousness and peace kiss each other.</p>

<p>Psalm 118:19-20</p>

<p>Open to me the gates of righteousness,</p>

<p>that I may enter through them</p>

<p>and give thanks to the LORD.</p>

<p>This is the gate of the LORD;</p>

<p>the righteous shall enter through it.</p>

<p>Psalm 145:7</p>

<p>They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness</p>

<p>and shall sing aloud of your righteousness.</p>

<p>Isaiah 61:10</p>

<p>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord;</p>

<p>my soul shall exult in my God,</p>

<p>for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;</p>

<p>he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,</p>

<p>as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,</p>

<p>and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</p>

<p>Isaiah 63:1</p>

<p>Who is this who comes from Edom,</p>

<p>in crimsoned garments from Bozrah,</p>

<p>he who is splendid in his apparel,</p>

<p>marching in the greatness of his strength?</p>

<p>“It is I, speaking in righteousness,</p>

<p>mighty to save.”</p>

<p>Isaiah 41:8-10</p>

<p>But you, Israel, my servant,</p>

<p>Jacob, whom I have chosen,</p>

<p>the offspring of Abraham, my friend;</p>

<p>you whom I took from the ends of the earth,</p>

<p>and called from its farthest corners,</p>

<p>saying to you, “You are my servant,</p>

<p>I have chosen you and not cast you off”;</p>

<p>fear not, for I am with you;</p>

<p>be not dismayed, for I am your God;</p>

<p>I will strengthen you, I will help you,</p>

<p>I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:20-25</p>

<p>“Assemble yourselves and come;</p>

<p>draw near together,</p>

<p>you survivors of the nations!</p>

<p>They have no knowledge</p>

<p>who carry about their wooden idols,</p>

<p>and keep on praying to a god</p>

<p>that cannot save.</p>

<p>Declare and present your case;</p>

<p>let them take counsel together!</p>

<p>Who told this long ago?</p>

<p>Who declared it of old?</p>

<p>Was it not I, the Lord?</p>

<p>And there is no other god besides me,</p>

<p>a righteous God and a Savior;</p>

<p>there is none besides me.</p>

<p>“Turn to me and be saved,</p>

<p>all the ends of the earth!</p>

<p>For I am God, and there is no other.</p>

<p>By myself I have sworn;</p>

<p>from my mouth has gone out in righteousness</p>

<p>a word that shall not return:</p>

<p>‘To me every knee shall bow,</p>

<p>every tongue shall swear allegiance.’</p>

<p>“Only in the Lord, it shall be said of me,</p>

<p>are righteousness and strength;</p>

<p>to him shall come and be ashamed</p>

<p>all who were incensed against him.</p>

<p>In the Lord all the offspring of Israel</p>

<p>shall be justified and shall glory.”</p>

<p>Matthew 5:2-12</p>

<p>And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</p>

<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>“Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</p>

<p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>“Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>

<p>Romans 3:20-28</p>

<p>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p>

<p>Romans 4:1-12</p>

<p>What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</p>

<p>For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</p>

<p>“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</p>

<p>and whose sins are covered;</p>

<p>blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”</p>

<p>Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p>

<p>Romans 4:13-25</p>

<p>For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</p>

<p>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.” He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb.</p>

<p>No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.” But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</p>

<p>Romans 5:12-21</p>

<p>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned— for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</p>

<p>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man’s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. And the free gift is not like the result of that one man’s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.</p>

<p>For if, because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Luke 15:20-24</p>

<p>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.</p>

<p>Psalm 17:15</p>

<p>As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;</p>

<p>when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.</p>

<p>1 Peter 3:18</p>

<p>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 5:21</p>

<p>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
