    <p>Genesis 6:5-6</p>

<p>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.</p>

<p>Lamentations 5:3</p>

<p>We have become orphans, fatherless;</p>

<p>our mothers are like widows.</p>

<p>1 Chronicles 29:15</p>

<p>For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 10:17-22</p>

<p>For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. You shall fear the LORD your God.</p>

<p>You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>Exodus 22:20-24</p>

<p>“You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child. If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.</p>

<p>Leviticus 19:33-34</p>

<p>“When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 14:29</p>

<p>And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 11:16-20</p>

<p>Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.’ Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’ And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations. And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 30:6</p>

<p>And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 30:11-20</p>

<p>“For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’ Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’ But the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.</p>

<p>“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil. If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you today, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it. But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them, I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish.</p>

<p>You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live, loving the Lord your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.”</p>

<p>Nehemiah 2:12</p>

<p>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode.</p>

<p>Psalm 19:14</p>

<p>Let the words of my mouth</p>

<p>and the meditation of my heart</p>

<p>be acceptable in your sight,</p>

<p>O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.</p>

<p>Psalm 20:4</p>

<p>May he grant you your heart’s desire</p>

<p>and fulfill all your plans!</p>

<p>Psalm 21:2</p>

<p>You have given him his heart’s desire</p>

<p>and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</p>

<p>Psalm 27:8</p>

<p>You have said, “Seek my face.”</p>

<p>My heart says to you,</p>

<p>“Your face, LORD, do I seek.”</p>

<p>Psalm 51:10</p>

<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</p>

<p>Psalm 73:25-26</p>

<p>Whom have I in heaven but you?</p>

<p>And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.</p>

<p>My flesh and my heart may fail,</p>

<p>but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>

<p>Psalm 84:2</p>

<p>My soul longs, yes, faints</p>

<p>for the courts of the Lord;</p>

<p>my heart and flesh sing for joy</p>

<p>to the living God.</p>

<p>Psalm 86:11-12</p>

<p>Teach me your way, O Lord,</p>

<p>that I may walk in your truth;</p>

<p>unite my heart to fear your name.</p>

<p>I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,</p>

<p>and I will glorify your name forever.</p>

<p>Acts 2:36-38</p>

<p>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”</p>

<p>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Acts 4:32</p>

<p>Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.</p>

<p>Galatians 4:6</p>

<p>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”</p>

<p>Ephesians 3:14-19</p>

<p>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>

<p>1 Peter 2:11</p>

<p>Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.</p>

<p>James 1:27</p>

<p>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</p>

<p>James 2:14-26</p>

<p>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</p>

<p>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</p>

<p>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.</p>

<p>Ephesians 2:8-10</p>

<p>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</p>

<p>Matthew 11:29</p>

<p>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</p>

<p>Matthew 5:8</p>

<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 3:5</p>

<p>May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.</p>
