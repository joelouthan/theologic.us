    <p>Titus 3:3</p>

<p>For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.</p>

<p>Exodus 6:1-9</p>

<p>But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”</p>

<p>God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them. I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.</p>

<p>Say therefore to the people of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.</p>

<p>I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.’” Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.</p>

<p>Psalm 102:18-22</p>

<p>Let this be recorded for a generation to come,</p>

<p>so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:</p>

<p>that he looked down from his holy height;</p>

<p>from heaven the Lord looked at the earth,</p>

<p>to hear the groans of the prisoners,</p>

<p>to set free those who were doomed to die,</p>

<p>that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord,</p>

<p>and in Jerusalem his praise,</p>

<p>when peoples gather together,</p>

<p>and kingdoms, to worship the Lord.</p>

<p>Isaiah 61:1-3</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,</p>

<p>because the Lord has anointed me</p>

<p>to bring good news to the poor;</p>

<p>he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,</p>

<p>to proclaim liberty to the captives,</p>

<p>and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;</p>

<p>to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor,</p>

<p>and the day of vengeance of our God;</p>

<p>to comfort all who mourn;</p>

<p>to grant to those who mourn in Zion—</p>

<p>to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,</p>

<p>the oil of gladness instead of mourning,</p>

<p>the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;</p>

<p>that they may be called oaks of righteousness,</p>

<p>the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.</p>

<p>Luke 7:22-23</p>

<p>And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”</p>

<p>Romans 6:15-23</p>

<p>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</p>

<p>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</p>

<p>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>Acts 3:1-10</p>

<p>Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.</p>

<p>And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, “Look at us.” And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, “I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!” And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

<p>Romans 8:18-23</p>

<p>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</p>

<p>Galatians 4:4-5</p>

<p>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:14-15</p>

<p>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.</p>

<p>Revelation 21:5-7</p>

<p>And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</p>
