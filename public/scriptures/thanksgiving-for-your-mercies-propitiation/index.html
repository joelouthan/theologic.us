    <p>Luke 18:13</p>

<p>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</p>

<p>Leviticus 6:28</p>

<p>And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:1-12</p>

<p>Who has believed what he has heard from us?</p>

<p>And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>

<p>For he grew up before him like a young plant,</p>

<p>and like a root out of dry ground;</p>

<p>he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,</p>

<p>and no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

<p>He was despised and rejected by men;</p>

<p>a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;</p>

<p>and as one from whom men hide their faces</p>

<p>he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>

<p>Surely he has borne our griefs</p>

<p>and carried our sorrows;</p>

<p>yet we esteemed him stricken,</p>

<p>smitten by God, and afflicted.</p>

<p>But he was wounded for our transgressions;</p>

<p>he was crushed for our iniquities;</p>

<p>upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,</p>

<p>and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p>All we like sheep have gone astray;</p>

<p>we have turned—every one—to his own way;</p>

<p>and the Lord has laid on him</p>

<p>the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,</p>

<p>yet he opened not his mouth;</p>

<p>like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,</p>

<p>and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,</p>

<p>so he opened not his mouth.</p>

<p>By oppression and judgment he was taken away;</p>

<p>and as for his generation, who considered</p>

<p>that he was cut off out of the land of the living,</p>

<p>stricken for the transgression of my people?</p>

<p>And they made his grave with the wicked</p>

<p>and with a rich man in his death,</p>

<p>although he had done no violence,</p>

<p>and there was no deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p>Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;</p>

<p>he has put him to grief;</p>

<p>when his soul makes an offering for guilt,</p>

<p>he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;</p>

<p>the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;</p>

<p>by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,</p>

<p>make many to be accounted righteous,</p>

<p>and he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

<p>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,</p>

<p>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</p>

<p>because he poured out his soul to death</p>

<p>and was numbered with the transgressors;</p>

<p>yet he bore the sin of many,</p>

<p>and makes intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<p>Psalm 22:1-31</p>

<p>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>

<p>Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?</p>

<p>O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,</p>

<p>and by night, but I find no rest.</p>

<p>Yet you are holy,</p>

<p>enthroned on the praises of Israel.</p>

<p>In you our fathers trusted;</p>

<p>they trusted, and you delivered them.</p>

<p>To you they cried and were rescued;</p>

<p>in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>

<p>But I am a worm and not a man,</p>

<p>scorned by mankind and despised by the people.</p>

<p>All who see me mock me;</p>

<p>they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;</p>

<p>“He trusts in the Lord; let him deliver him;</p>

<p>let him rescue him, for he delights in him!”</p>

<p>Yet you are he who took me from the womb;</p>

<p>you made me trust you at my mother’s breasts.</p>

<p>On you was I cast from my birth,</p>

<p>and from my mother’s womb you have been my God.</p>

<p>Be not far from me,</p>

<p>for trouble is near,</p>

<p>and there is none to help.</p>

<p>Many bulls encompass me;</p>

<p>strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</p>

<p>they open wide their mouths at me,</p>

<p>like a ravening and roaring lion.</p>

<p>I am poured out like water,</p>

<p>and all my bones are out of joint;</p>

<p>my heart is like wax;</p>

<p>it is melted within my breast;</p>

<p>my strength is dried up like a potsherd,</p>

<p>and my tongue sticks to my jaws;</p>

<p>you lay me in the dust of death.</p>

<p>For dogs encompass me;</p>

<p>a company of evildoers encircles me;</p>

<p>they have pierced my hands and feet—</p>

<p>I can count all my bones—</p>

<p>they stare and gloat over me;</p>

<p>they divide my garments among them,</p>

<p>and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>

<p>But you, O Lord, do not be far off!</p>

<p>O you my help, come quickly to my aid!</p>

<p>Deliver my soul from the sword,</p>

<p>my precious life from the power of the dog!</p>

<p>Save me from the mouth of the lion!</p>

<p>You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!</p>

<p>I will tell of your name to my brothers;</p>

<p>in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:</p>

<p>You who fear the Lord, praise him!</p>

<p>All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him,</p>

<p>and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!</p>

<p>For he has not despised or abhorred</p>

<p>the affliction of the afflicted,</p>

<p>and he has not hidden his face from him,</p>

<p>but has heard, when he cried to him.</p>

<p>From you comes my praise in the great congregation;</p>

<p>my vows I will perform before those who fear him.</p>

<p>The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;</p>

<p>those who seek him shall praise the Lord!</p>

<p>May your hearts live forever!</p>

<p>All the ends of the earth shall remember</p>

<p>and turn to the Lord,</p>

<p>and all the families of the nations</p>

<p>shall worship before you.</p>

<p>For kingship belongs to the Lord,</p>

<p>and he rules over the nations.</p>

<p>All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;</p>

<p>before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,</p>

<p>even the one who could not keep himself alive.</p>

<p>Posterity shall serve him;</p>

<p>it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;</p>

<p>they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn,</p>

<p>that he has done it.</p>

<p>Lamentations 3:1-24</p>

<p>I am the man who has seen affliction</p>

<p>under the rod of his wrath;</p>

<p>he has driven and brought me</p>

<p>into darkness without any light;</p>

<p>surely against me he turns his hand</p>

<p>again and again the whole day long.</p>

<p>He has made my flesh and my skin waste away;</p>

<p>he has broken my bones;</p>

<p>he has besieged and enveloped me</p>

<p>with bitterness and tribulation;</p>

<p>he has made me dwell in darkness</p>

<p>like the dead of long ago.</p>

<p>He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;</p>

<p>he has made my chains heavy;</p>

<p>though I call and cry for help,</p>

<p>he shuts out my prayer;</p>

<p>he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones;</p>

<p>he has made my paths crooked.</p>

<p>He is a bear lying in wait for me,</p>

<p>a lion in hiding;</p>

<p>he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces;</p>

<p>he has made me desolate;</p>

<p>he bent his bow and set me</p>

<p>as a target for his arrow.</p>

<p>He drove into my kidneys</p>

<p>the arrows of his quiver;</p>

<p>I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,</p>

<p>the object of their taunts all day long.</p>

<p>He has filled me with bitterness;</p>

<p>he has sated me with wormwood.</p>

<p>He has made my teeth grind on gravel,</p>

<p>and made me cower in ashes;</p>

<p>my soul is bereft of peace;</p>

<p>I have forgotten what happiness is;</p>

<p>so I say, “My endurance has perished;</p>

<p>so has my hope from the Lord.”</p>

<p>Remember my affliction and my wanderings,</p>

<p>the wormwood and the gall!</p>

<p>My soul continually remembers it</p>

<p>and is bowed down within me.</p>

<p>But this I call to mind,</p>

<p>and therefore I have hope:</p>

<p>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;</p>

<p>his mercies never come to an end;</p>

<p>they are new every morning;</p>

<p>great is your faithfulness.</p>

<p>“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,</p>

<p>“therefore I will hope in him.”</p>

<p>Luke 23:44-49</p>

<p>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun’s light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last. Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!” And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.</p>

<p>Romans 3:21-26</p>

<p>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.</p>

<p>For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:17</p>

<p>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>

<p>1 John 1:9</p>

<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>

<p>1 John 2:2</p>

<p>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>

<p>1 John 4:10</p>

<p>In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>

<p>John 3:36</p>

<p>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</p>

<p>Revelation 19:11-12</p>

<p>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>

<p>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</p>
