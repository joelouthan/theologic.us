<p><strong>Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The LORD.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.” And the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”</strong></p>

<p>Leviticus 9:6</p>

<p><strong>And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”</strong></p>

<p>1 Chronicles 29:10-18</p>

<p><strong>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: “Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.</strong></p>

<p><strong>O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.</strong></p>

<p>Psalm 8:1-9</p>

<p><strong>O LORD, our Lord,</strong></p>

<p><strong>how majestic is your name in all the earth!</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have set your glory above the heavens.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Out of the mouth of babies and infants,</strong></p>

<p><strong>you have established strength because of your foes,</strong></p>

<p><strong>to still the enemy and the avenger.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,</strong></p>

<p><strong>the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</strong></p>

<p><strong>what is man that you are mindful of him,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the son of man that you care for him?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings</strong></p>

<p><strong>and crowned him with glory and honor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;</strong></p>

<p><strong>you have put all things under his feet,</strong></p>

<p><strong>all sheep and oxen,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and also the beasts of the field,</strong></p>

<p><strong>the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,</strong></p>

<p><strong>whatever passes along the paths of the seas.</strong></p>

<p><strong>O LORD, our Lord,</strong></p>

<p><strong>how majestic is your name in all the earth!</strong></p>

<p>Psalm 19:1</p>

<p><strong>The heavens declare the glory of God,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 6:1-7</p>

<p><strong>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;</strong></p>

<p><strong>the whole earth is full of his glory!”</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 41:14-16</p>

<p><strong>Fear not, you worm Jacob,</strong></p>

<p><strong>you men of Israel!</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am the one who helps you, declares the Lord;</strong></p>

<p><strong>your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge,</strong></p>

<p><strong>new, sharp, and having teeth;</strong></p>

<p><strong>you shall thresh the mountains and crush them,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and you shall make the hills like chaff;</strong></p>

<p><strong>you shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the tempest shall scatter them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And you shall rejoice in the Lord;</strong></p>

<p><strong>in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 42:8</p>

<p><strong>I am the LORD; that is my name;</strong></p>

<p><strong>my glory I give to no other,</strong></p>

<p><strong>nor my praise to carved idols.</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 48:11</p>

<p><strong>For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,</strong></p>

<p><strong>for how should my name be profaned?</strong></p>

<p><strong>My glory I will not give to another.</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 66:18</p>

<p><strong>“For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,</strong></p>

<p>Ezekiel 1:28</p>

<p><strong>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</strong></p>

<p>Daniel 7:9-14</p>

<p><strong>“As I looked,</strong></p>

<p><strong>thrones were placed,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the Ancient of Days took his seat;</strong></p>

<p><strong>his clothing was white as snow,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the hair of his head like pure wool;</strong></p>

<p><strong>his throne was fiery flames;</strong></p>

<p><strong>its wheels were burning fire.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A stream of fire issued</strong></p>

<p><strong>and came out from before him;</strong></p>

<p><strong>a thousand thousands served him,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;</strong></p>

<p><strong>the court sat in judgment,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and the books were opened.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I saw in the night visions,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and behold, with the clouds of heaven</strong></p>

<p><strong>there came one like a son of man,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and he came to the Ancient of Days</strong></p>

<p><strong>and was presented before him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And to him was given dominion</strong></p>

<p><strong>and glory and a kingdom,</strong></p>

<p><strong>that all peoples, nations, and languages</strong></p>

<p><strong>should serve him;</strong></p>

<p><strong>his dominion is an everlasting dominion,</strong></p>

<p><strong>which shall not pass away,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and his kingdom one</strong></p>

<p><strong>that shall not be destroyed.</strong></p>

<p>Habakkuk 2:14</p>

<p><strong>For the earth will be filled</strong></p>

<p><strong>with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD</strong></p>

<p><strong>as the waters cover the sea.</strong></p>

<p>Haggai 1:8</p>

<p><strong>Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD.</strong></p>

<p>Zephaniah 3:17</p>

<p><strong>The LORD your God is in your midst,</strong></p>

<p><strong>a mighty one who will save;</strong></p>

<p><strong>he will rejoice over you with gladness;</strong></p>

<p><strong>he will quiet you by his love;</strong></p>

<p><strong>he will exult over you with loud singing.</strong></p>

<p>Matthew 25:31-46</p>

<p><strong>“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</strong></p>

<p>****<strong>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’</strong></p>

<p>****<strong>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</strong></p>

<p>Mark 13:26-27</p>

<p><strong>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</strong></p>

<p>Luke 2:8-21</p>

<p><strong>And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Glory to God in the highest,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”</strong></p>

<p><strong>When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</strong></p>

<p>John 9:24-25</p>

<p><strong>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” He answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”</strong></p>

<p>John 11:40-43</p>

<p><strong>Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.” When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.”</strong></p>

<p>John 12:23</p>

<p><strong>And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</strong></p>

<p>John 12:27-36</p>

<p><strong>“Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the</strong> <strong>darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.</strong></p>

<p>Philippians 2:9-11</p>

<p><strong>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</strong></p>

<p>2 Timothy 2:10</p>

<p><strong>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</strong></p>

<p>Hebrews 1:3-4</p>

<p><strong>He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</strong></p>

<p>James 2:1</p>

<p><strong>My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.</strong></p>

<p>1 Peter 1:20-21</p>

<p><strong>He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</strong></p>

<p>Revelation 19:1-22:21</p>

<p><strong>After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Hallelujah!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</strong></p>

<p><strong>for his judgments are true and just;</strong></p>

<p><strong>for he has judged the great prostitute</strong></p>

<p><strong>who corrupted the earth with her immorality,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Once more they cried out,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Hallelujah!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” And from the throne came a voice saying,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Praise our God,</strong></p>

<p><strong>all you his servants,</strong></p>

<p><strong>you who fear him,</strong></p>

<p><strong>small and great.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Hallelujah!</strong></p>

<p><strong>For the Lord our God</strong></p>

<p><strong>the Almighty reigns.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let us rejoice and exult</strong></p>

<p><strong>and give him the glory,</strong></p>

<p><strong>for the marriage of the Lamb has come,</strong></p>

<p><strong>and his Bride has made herself ready;</strong></p>

<p><strong>it was granted her to clothe herself</strong></p>

<p><strong>with fine linen, bright and pure”—</strong></p>

<p><strong>for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were</strong></p>

<p><strong>thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be</strong></p>

<p><strong>released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,</strong></p>

<p><strong>coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.” And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,</strong></p>

<p><strong>having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed— on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls. The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel’s measurement. The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Psalm 17:15</p>

<p><strong>As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;</strong></p>

<p><strong>when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.</strong></p>

<p>Romans 8:1-39</p>

<p><strong>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,</strong></p>

<p><strong>“For your sake we are being killed all the day long;</strong></p>

<p><strong>we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Romans 11:36</p>

<p><strong>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</strong></p>
