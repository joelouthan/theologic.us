    <p>Exodus 29:43</p>

<p>There I will meet with the people of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory.</p>

<p>Exodus 31:13</p>

<p>“You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.</p>

<p>Leviticus 10:3</p>

<p>Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD has said, ‘Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” And Aaron held his peace.</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:8</p>

<p>Keep my statutes and do them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you.</p>

<p>Leviticus 21:8</p>

<p>You shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I, the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.</p>

<p>Leviticus 21:22-23</p>

<p>He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things, but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”</p>

<p>Leviticus 22:9</p>

<p>They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctifies them.</p>

<p>Leviticus 22:15-16</p>

<p>They shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD, and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”</p>

<p>Leviticus 22:31-33</p>

<p>“So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD. And you shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. I am the LORD who sanctifies you, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD.”</p>

<p>Psalm 57:2</p>

<p>I cry out to God Most High,</p>

<p>to God who fulfills his purpose for me.</p>

<p>Psalm 138:8</p>

<p>The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me;</p>

<p>your steadfast love, O LORD, endures forever.</p>

<p>Do not forsake the work of your hands.</p>

<p>Isaiah 29:23</p>

<p>For when he sees his children,</p>

<p>the work of my hands, in his midst,</p>

<p>they will sanctify my name;</p>

<p>they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob</p>

<p>and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 7:24</p>

<p>I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 20:12</p>

<p>Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 37:28</p>

<p>Then the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.”</p>

<p>John 17:17-19</p>

<p>Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</p>

<p>Acts 20:32</p>

<p>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</p>

<p>Acts 26:15-18</p>

<p>And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles—to whom I am sending you to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</p>

<p>Romans 6:19-23</p>

<p>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations.</p>

<p>For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</p>

<p>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>Romans 8:13</p>

<p>For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</p>

<p>Romans 8:28-30</p>

<p>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>

<p>Romans 15:14-16</p>

<p>I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another. But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:2-3</p>

<p>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:30-31</p>

<p>And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 6:9-11</p>

<p>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:10-11</p>

<p>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</p>

<p>Ephesians 5:25-27</p>

<p>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.</p>

<p>Philippians 1:6</p>

<p>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Philippians 2:12-13</p>

<p>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 4:3-8</p>

<p>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 5:24</p>

<p>He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</p>

<p>But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers, stand firm</p>

<p>and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:11-13</p>

<p>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying,</p>

<p>“I will tell of your name to my brothers;</p>

<p>in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”</p>

<p>And again,</p>

<p>“I will put my trust in him.”</p>

<p>And again,</p>

<p>“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”</p>

<p>Hebrews 9:13-14</p>

<p>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>

<p>Hebrews 10:10</p>

<p>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<p>Hebrews 10:14-18</p>

<p>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>

<p>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</p>

<p>“This is the covenant that I will make with them</p>

<p>after those days, declares the Lord:</p>

<p>I will put my laws on their hearts,</p>

<p>and write them on their minds,”</p>

<p>then he adds,</p>

<p>“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”</p>

<p>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>

<p>Hebrews 13:12</p>

<p>So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.</p>

<p>Hebrews 13:20-21</p>

<p>Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1 Peter 1:1-2</p>

<p>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:</p>

<p>May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</p>
