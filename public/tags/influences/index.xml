      <title>Influences: No Condemnation in Christ Jesus by Octavius Winslow</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/books/influences-no-condemnation-in-christ-jesus-by-octavius-winslow/</link>

      <description>Why haven&amp;#8217;t you read this book yet?
If I had to recommend just one book not including the Bible, it would be this book—above all other works and above all other commentaries. Many call Romans 8, &amp;#8220;The Mount Everest of the Bible&amp;#8221;. Martin Luther called it, &amp;#8220;the clearest gospel of all&amp;#8221;.
It is with this little paperback Octavius Winslow separates himself from the pack of scholars and theologians. I feel like it wasn&amp;#8217;t that Winslow had to explain the depth and weight of Romans 8 for the scholarly purposes but he had to write this book because if he did not, his heart would have burst in worship and love to our sweet God and Lord.</description>

      <description>A sight for sore eyes.
No words have rang truer except for the Son of Man.
The One God who cross the infinite just to save me.
Now my eyes bleared at the first site of him.
The loveliness of his face.
I look into His eyes and my soul is complete. My heart is joy-filled. My mind now knows fully.
I am content.
I am satisfied.
God is perfect in his work in me.</description>

      <title>Influences: What Else Can I Say? Psalm 16:11</title>

      <description>The God who alone is awesome.
This is Love, Election, Calling, Atonement, Justification, Propitiation, Expiation, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification rolled into one.
Even typing these words, meagerly and fumblingly, is drawing away from the sheer beauty, breath snatching, eye-rubbing gorgeousness, ever-swelling joy, tear-pouring grace and heart-bursting love that is this one verse.
Psalm 16:11
**You make known to me the path of life;
in your presence there is fullness of joy;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Every instinct preached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every thought taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any book studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every sermon heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every theology revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every doctrine learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any and all things processed were with Romans 8 in my sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard it said, &amp;#8220;The Epistle to the Romans is the Himalayas of the Bible and with Romans 8 is the Everest.&amp;#8221; Martin Luther calls Romans 8, &amp;#8220;the clearest Gospel of them all&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to memorize any passage of Scripture, it is because I wanted to get to where I can memorize Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any passage memorized now is because I am camped out on the summit that is Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorized it. Dwelled on it. Read about it. Focused on it. Prayed on it. Prayed using it. Recite it. Practiced preaching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write a multi-part blog series on the entirety of Romans 8 in a few weeks so I won&amp;#8217;t expand on it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, enjoy your view of God&amp;#8217;s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Either I was dead or I wasn’t.
Either I was following the course of this world or I wasn’t.
Either I was following Satan or I wasn’t.
Either I was a son of disobedience or I wasn’t.
If I deny to be any of those things or pretend I was not that bad off, then God did not come to save me.
Luke 5:31-32 And Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</description>

What can I say?
I pray to worship You.
I pray to praise Your holy name forever.
I pray to sing to You.
I pray because I want You.
I pray because I need You near.
I pray because I have no life without You.
I pray because You are my Lord and God.
I pray because You are my Father.</description>

      <description>Nine times out of ten, every other story not in Genesis can be traced back to Genesis. (I logically suspect that that other one time is simply because I am a novice scholar.)
Forgive me as I do this off the top of my noggin but if I am not mistaken, all Biblical doctrines originates in Genesis in a very direct way. 1{#return-note-1105-1.simple-footnote}

      <description>This was the very first passage I memorized. I picked this passage because I heard this particular verse mentioned in a long list of other verses:
1 Chronicles 29:14 “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
When I looked up the verse and read it in context, I was blown away from David&amp;#8217;s commencement.</description>

      <description>All of our sins are laid bare before us.
When we truly see who we really are, we see our shunning of God’s wisdom; ignoring of God’s word; our turning away from His lovely face; our insistence to the crap the world has offer; our addiction to the pains and sickness; and our desires fueled by the love for ourselves at the increase of hate and apathy towards one another.</description>

      <description>Answer: God.
Well, that was easy.
In all seriousness, I got a tweet from a friend of mine:
 Will you share with me some of the blogs/people you read? I love reading and being encouraged by deep thinkers.  Which, in turn, made me think: How did I get here? Why do I think the way that I do? Who has God used to shape my faith in Him, my knowledge of Him and my love of Him?</description>

If I have set the direction of my theology based on the thread of Hebrews 6:1-3, 1 Corinthians 3:21-23, and 1 Corinthians 2:12-13, then I would have to say this would be the basis for all of my reading, studying, writing, lecturing, preaching, and teaching:
1 Corinthians 2:2 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</description>

What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory—even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?

      <description>The Prophet Jeremiah by Michelangelo BuonarrotiIn and around April 2007, I was saved. In and around May 2007, it occurs to me that I should start reading the Bible. I prayed and I felt like I should start with Jeremiah.
Every since reading Jeremiah, there were four truths that did a number on my freshly renewed mind (oddly enough, Jeremiah 29:11 was not one of them):
 God appoints us to Him before we were born:  Jeremiah 1:4-8 Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</description>

      <title>Influences: Love Song – Psalm 119</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/scriptures/influences-love-song-psalm-119/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://theologic.us/scriptures/influences-love-song-psalm-119/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119 is the love song to God for all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/record_needle_body_203x152.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-964&#34; title=&#34;record_needle_body_203x152&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/record_needle_body_203x152.jpg?resize=203%2C152&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;203&#34; height=&#34;152&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It is the extended, smooth-out, quiet storm version. It’s the singer’s voice dropping to a bass-baritone. It is the passion towards the one the writer loves. It has the ultra-smooth whispers of sweet desires over the radio waves and the crackle of the vinyl in the extended beatdrop. This song is the mixtape track that says everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was made for one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is all about His righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psalmist is not in love with the law. The love was never directed towards a bunch of rules that they could never perfectly do. If I fail to do them all correctly, I have fallen. If I break one rule, I have failed. If fail to do one rule, then I separated from my precious love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I realized that there were some laws that supersedes my material reality, I have already failed. If I never realized the laws, then surely I have gone against my conscience and &lt;em&gt;seared&lt;/em&gt; my conscience from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damned if I do and damned if I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What hope do I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I have faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but I have love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have love for the One who did it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the King who wrote the laws and perfectly followed them to the letter. And my lawgiving King doesn’t hold His law over my head. Instead, He showers me with His banner of love over my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My King has me. He has it all. He just needs me to look into His eyes, hold his hands, and trust Him when He says, “Everything’s gonna be alright.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to lead a Bible Study. The very first book we studied through was the book of Ruth. Verse by verse. Chapter by chapter.
Given our group consisted of young adults, most of them were single, it was easy to quickly identify with, or want to be identified with, each of the key figures in this little story in the Bible.

      <description>I believe, trust, understand, love, and think by this principle: my entire grasp, knowledge, relationship, salvation, and love to God, for God, by God, from God, and through God is according to these three Scriptures:
Hebrews 6:1-3 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</description>

      <description>Romans 15:17-21 In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God—so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ; and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else&amp;#8217;s foundation, but as it is written, “Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.</description>
