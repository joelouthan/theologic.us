      <description>Series: Once a month, I get to teach the Elementary kids during our main Worship Gatherings. My incredible Children&amp;#8217;s Pastor, Kim, does the amazing work of feeding me that weekend&amp;#8217;s lesson, much like a lectionary. There will be a power verse, the lesson (or the reading) and then the accompanied Bible passage. Quite often, God will linked everything together to His Son and to His gospel which I am to believe the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 2:12) is through the power of the Holy Spirit.</description>
