      <description>Wilson: &amp;#8220;God knew that we were going to need to pick up dimes, and so He gave us fingernails. He knew that twilights displayed in blue, apricot, and battle gray would be entirely astonishing and beyond us, and so He gave us eyes that can see in color. He could have made all food quite nourishing, but which tasted like wadded up newspaper soaked in machine oil. Instead He gave us the tastes of watermelon, pecans, oatmeal stout, buttered corn, apples, fresh bread, grilled sirloin, and 25-year-old scotch.</description>

      <description>Good, good, good, so good.
Wilson is top-notch and has the upper hand to give the response.
Hitchens is spot-on typical atheist:
 Remove God from the equation Plug-in Evolution as the new source Profit$  In this, the main hard-hitting topic was Morals and Ethics or the source of Morals and Ethics.
Wilson&amp;#8217;s explanation needs none here. Hitchens&amp;#8217; explanation is that there is no source but rather, our morals have evolved.</description>

      <title>We Haven’t Evolved In Rising Above Sin</title>

      <description>Wilson: You say, incidentally, that this kind of law was bringing coals to Newcastle—Moses came down from the mount and told people that murder, theft, and perjury were wrong, and all the assembled rolled their collective eyes. &amp;#8220;We already knew that!&amp;#8221; But the problem is that ancient man didn&amp;#8217;t know that, and modern man still doesn&amp;#8217;t know it. To state some of the issues that are subsumed under just one of the three categories you mention is to point to controversies that continue down to this day.</description>
