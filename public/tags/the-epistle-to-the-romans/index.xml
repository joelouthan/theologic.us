      <description>Romans 8:38–39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
In the year of our 2018, we have Christians contending that their faith would be unshaken if the resurrection never took place.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. All of the questions, pushbacks, and opposition that Paul was facing with teaching this one particular truth of God as a through but simple exposition of Christ’s own words when He said: I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.  My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.</description>

      <title>Here is Love: Romans 8:36 Sheep to the Slaughter</title>

      <description>Romans 8:36 As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” So what if a little “tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?” 1 comes our way? God promises suffering for his saints. There is no way around it. Just in case you are at odds with the rest of the authors of the Bible and only want the “red letter edition”, let us consider the words of Christ himself: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth.</description>

      <description>And here is love: Romans 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? I am not here to try to define for you what each of these circumstances means. I am 43 years old who lives in the Bible Belt of the United States and have been a believer for a quarter of my life.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:34 Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Let’s try to find a verse that sums up the whole Bible concerning the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and you will have your choice of a few verses: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</description>

      <description>Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. 1 This world and its inhabitants, princes, rulers, and principalities crouching, and ready to pounce and devour your heart and soul. They are not always going to do it with outright accusations, but they might resort to that. “Look at your life! Look at all the mistakes you’ve made! You can’t even stay married.” “You are a failure!</description>

      <description>Romans 8:32 He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? I could sit here and blast you with God’s holy words about God alone provides for us, and we need nothing. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 1 It is more than “I don’t want” like we are monks in Timbuktu living off the land but rather, because God adopted us, we are co-heirs with the One who has inherited all things.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? The love of God cannot be simply defined by the merest of affections and words that we might share with one another. Is our relationship to our spouse, children, family, co-workers, or neighbor compare to one’s relationship with God? Although our relationships should be held in the light of God’s relationship with us, it is perposturous to think that anybody we know would compare to God is perfect in all things especially when it comes to love.</description>

      <title>Romans 8:30d Glorified</title>

      <description>And here is love: “… and for those whom he justified he also glorified.” We look up all of Romans 8:30 as a chain that begins and ends with God. To that end, predestination and glorification are things that our minds cannot fully fathom. But we rest assure that every single person predestined is called is justified is glorified. There is no whittling or dwindling of numbers as we move along the list, Christ said, “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</description>

      <description>And here is love: &amp;#8230; and those whom he called he also justified...
This is the steadfast chain of salvation that links us to God forever and ever.
Predestination is God&amp;#8217;s mere thoughts, affections, will, and decisions towards us. From eternity past, God thought of us specifically and was mindful of us intentionally.
Calling is the voice of God that actively makes us alive in our dead and sinful state. The calling of God is the voice of the Father bringing us to life and calling us according to His purpose.</description>

      <description>And here is love: Romans 8:30b And those whom he predestined he also called… So if there was nothing in us to attract, sway, or convinced God to love us and save us, what did God see in us before He saved us? There is a war in our world to determine the value of a human’s life. Life today is no longer precious. Consider the life of a newborn or the life of a refugee.</description>

      <description>And here is love: Romans 8:30a And those whom he predestined … We have now established that God loved us not just for the sake of love by itself. It is a warm and sentiment notion to be sure but when it comes to God, it is not just simply His love as though he can be reduced to one feeling. Likewise, while his love remains supreme, it isn’t all that he is.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.  When we carefully walked through verse 29 of Romans 8, we saw that there was more than a few questions that rose to the top, namely: What did God saw in us?We now know that he didn’t see anything good, righteousness or lovely.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.  This entire series has been trying to pit the world’s definition of love versus God’s definition of love. And perhaps up until this moment, we have never taken that to actual task. What I mean by that is that comparatively speaking, if I speak of God’s love, we can still find something like that in on earth.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
When we speak of Romans 8, most Christians rightfully cling to the verse 1: There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. But Romans 8:1 is not the very first line of this epistle from Paul to the church in Rome.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
So we have firmly established that God did not look into the future and see that I was good enough to be saved. I did not make the right decision to be saved or do a bunch of “good” works to be saved.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
There are many verses that can be used to aptly say what verse twenty-nine so succinctly and definitely says here. I can think of two passages:
1 Peter 1:20–21 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
Herein lies love: all things work together for good for those who love God. Within our world, one might dare to ask, “What about those who don’t love God? What about my friend or neighbor or co-worker who is basically a good guy or gal?</description>

      <description>Romans 8:26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
When coming to the full acknowledgment of the pain and anguish of sin that he seems to never be able to overcome, Paul cries the same incredible prayer in the same spirit as the tax collector in the synagogue:</description>

Romans 8:24-25 For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
What is this hope?
Walk backwards from the text. Our hope in adoption as sons? Redemption of our bodies? That creation would be set from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God?</description>

      <description>What is there to look forward to?
Romans 8:23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
My mother abandoned me when I was five years old and I never seen her since. My father physically, emotionally, mentally, and sexually abused me when I was a child. While I have “grown” physically, my heart and my emotional growth stunted to that of a child.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:19–22 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.</description>

      <description>Why even bother?
****Romans 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
That is why we bother.
If your affections, desires, and wants are places on Christ alone, then there is everything that we have endured and suffered will not compared to seeing His glory. What is glory? Here is my weak, futile, mortal attempt to explain what glory is:</description>

Is there life? Do we live in this world? Will you suffer anxiety, worry, depression, angst, anger, frustration, and rage?
Will you suffer pain, hurt, torment, cancer, sickness, disease, anguish, and death?
Will you suffer forgetfulness, confusion, doubt, and disbelief?
Will you suffer?
I don’t have to explain all of life and all of mankind to you. You already know this. If you don’t know this, then you are blind and don’t see life around you.</description>

What does it mean to be a child of God?
To ask that is to ask: What does it mean for the Father to set his affections upon you? What does it mean for Christ to love you, pursue you, die for you, and then live for you?</description>

      <description>Romans 8:16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
What can I say when I am in the presence of the Almighty God?
I have no defense!
All of my works of righteousness are as used bloody tampons before God.
Everything I did before knowing God was regarded as crap.
This is what I hold in my hands, bloody tampons and shit, before the incredible, awesome, magnificent, glorious Creator God of the Universe, who is high, lifted up, and exalted far above me, my thoughts, my pride, my sin, my iniquities, and my pitiful gods.</description>

Can you have both the spirit of slavery and the Spirit of adoption?
Never mind just twelve verses ago (Romans 8:3-8) that we have already made that distinction. So, let us see what Christ says:

      <description>Romans 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
What does it mean to be led?
The Holy Spirit is a comfort, a teacher, and a bringer of peace. Never is the Spirit of God associated with violence or forcefulness. So what does it mean to be led? Does this mean that Holy Spirit drags the kicking and screaming sons of God to Jesus Christ?</description>

      <description>Romans 8:12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
What is the debt?****
In other words, what is there to give to our old life. What do we owe to our former cold hearts of stone? How can you give dead man anything? Paul said it already in Romans 6:
We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
What is righteousness?
Righteousness is when you are constantly, consistently, always perfect. It is continuous thread of how God is able to do everything: love, create, judge, save, redeem, rescue, glorify.
None of us, any human being, born of Adam, is able to claim righteousness as our own.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:7 For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God&amp;#8217;s law; indeed, it cannot.
What is Paul suggesting here? That the mind that is not renewed by the Spirit of God cannot possibly obey God’s law? So does that mean we are not breaking the law of God and therefore sinless before God?Absolutely, not!
The mind of man is broken.</description>

The poison from my tongue
My hatred.
My self-righteousness.

&lt;p&gt;Every theology revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every doctrine learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any and all things processed were with Romans 8 in my sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard it said, &amp;#8220;The Epistle to the Romans is the Himalayas of the Bible and with Romans 8 is the Everest.&amp;#8221; Martin Luther calls Romans 8, &amp;#8220;the clearest Gospel of them all&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to memorize any passage of Scripture, it is because I wanted to get to where I can memorize Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any passage memorized now is because I am camped out on the summit that is Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorized it. Dwelled on it. Read about it. Focused on it. Prayed on it. Prayed using it. Recite it. Practiced preaching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write a multi-part blog series on the entirety of Romans 8 in a few weeks so I won&amp;#8217;t expand on it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, enjoy your view of God&amp;#8217;s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Here is love: Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
I am confident that 99.8% of people reading this was born in the 20th century. Historically speaking, Christ died about 2000 years ago. I am going to link these two ideas in one moment.
Christ is fully God. That means He fully sees all and fully knows all.</description>
