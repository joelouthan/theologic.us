      <description>Why haven&amp;#8217;t you read this book yet?
If I had to recommend just one book not including the Bible, it would be this bookâ€”above all other works and above all other commentaries. Many call Romans 8, &amp;#8220;The Mount Everest of the Bible&amp;#8221;. Martin Luther called it, &amp;#8220;the clearest gospel of all&amp;#8221;.
It is with this little paperback Octavius Winslow separates himself from the pack of scholars and theologians. I feel like it wasn&amp;#8217;t that Winslow had to explain the depth and weight of Romans 8 for the scholarly purposes but he had to write this book because if he did not, his heart would have burst in worship and love to our sweet God and Lord.</description>
