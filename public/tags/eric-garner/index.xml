      <description>I will not attempt to explain way this atrocity. Similar to when our Patristic leaders had to make up words in order to explain the Incarnation of God, so too I will not do a disservice to Eric Garner&amp;#8217;s life by explaining away theologically.
  I will say this: this is one of the many countless ways that Christ came to make right. It&amp;#8217;s not good right now but Christ promises he will make it good.</description>
