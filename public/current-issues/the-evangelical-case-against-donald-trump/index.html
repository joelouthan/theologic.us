    <p>Since the 2016 Presidential Election, I definitely regret many things. Most of which, the lashing out in anger against Trump, his Nazi administration, and his White Evangelical followers who empowered him.</p>

<p>But all of that anger and frustration is really all in vain. You see, for all of that energy spent, I have gain nothing. I have not done anything significant. Nothing has changed.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed because I haven&#8217;t really been about anything significant. To be against something is not really being for anything. To oppose something really isn&#8217;t anything. What I need to be about is something that will conquer evil and oppression. And that something is the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>I have stated many times that racism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia are not mere social issues that most Evangelicals have grown up falsely believing but are actually antithetical to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>But to say such a thing is to assume that readers here know what is the gospel and why do those things actually oppose it.</p>

<p>What is the gospel of God? Simply stated: the gospel is the power of God in salvation for those who believe. (Romans 1:16)</p>

<p>Yes, the gospel are the words that absolutely declared what God has done and what God will do to save His people to himself. No more and no less.</p>

<p>This goes all the way back Genesis 3 when all of the universe was broken by the mere breaking of God&#8217;s law. All things, including mankind, began its descent into chaos and death. But God the Creator, came to mankind and spoke the good news that He himself will reverse this descent and restore all of those things back to himself. This first proclamation of the good news is called the <em>protoevangelium</em> <a href="#note-3163-1" title="Genesis 3:15"><sup>1</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-1.simple-footnote}. We know that the people whom he preached this news to, Adam and Eve, believed because while they slept, God took away their own works of self-righteousness, slain an animal and spilled its blood (as a foretelling of what would need to happen in order for his people to be saved) and covered Adam and Eve with his own works righteousness <a href="#note-3163-2" title="Genesis 3:21"><sup>2</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-2.simple-footnote}.</p>

<p>God completes his promise of restoration, goodness, holiness, and perfection by doing the nearly the very same thing later but this time, it was when the Father sent His Son to be slain in His people&#8217;s place for their sins. His Son became human, and his name is Jesus Christ, lived a life by the power of the Holy Spirit, gave up his life so that he could die, but by the power of that same Spirit, he arose into life and now He is ascended to the right hand of his Father.</p>

<p>When that happened over two thousand years ago, those people who have come and trust in God to save them, their salvation was completed. Their salvation was finished because what God had promised to do, he alone can finish the work and by the very definition of God, he has to complete the work. He has no choice because He is all powerful and is the only one who can fulfill those promises.</p>

<p>Do you believe and trust in God and what He has done? Then that salvation is for you.</p>

<p>Listen, if you don&#8217;t believe, then the gospel is not for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. <a href="#note-3163-3" title="Romans 1:16"><sup>3</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-3.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. <a href="#note-3163-4" title="John 3:16"><sup>4</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-4.simple-footnote}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the gospel does not contain is any amount of hatred, this includes racism, bigotry, and fear.</p>

<p>We know that God does not save a particular people group, as has so many preachers falsely taught that God will completely save the inhabitants of Israel. When in fact, we look throughout the Bible and we find that God saves only those who came to trust and believed in Him. You are not born into this salvation, whether be by birth or by your will, but by the will of God who saves. <a href="#note-3163-5" title="John 1:12-13, John 3:1-15"><sup>5</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-5.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>So racism cannot be justified by the gospel so it is not part of the gospel. The gospel has no room for such a sin. (We know racism to be a sin. See Numbers 12:1-16)</p>

<p>Bigotry is the intolerance of someone who is different from you or thinks differently from you. Here&#8217;s the thing that many churchgoers don&#8217;t realize: the gospel is not an answer on a multiple choice test. It is the absolute truth. All of &#8220;truths&#8221; in the world that differ from this is actually not true. Many people in the world including many people in the church oppose this because we don&#8217;t want anybody condemned and we want everyone to have a chance to be saved. But we know that there is no other name by which we are saved <a href="#note-3163-6" title="Acts 4:12, John 14:6"><sup>6</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-6.simple-footnote}.  So with that in mind, and in the truest sense off the word, all of those who do not believe God are different from you and they think differently from you. And you want to what? Be intolerant to their existence when in fact, there was a time when you were an enemy and a traitor against the God of the universe?</p>

<p>So that the God of the universe was not intolerant to you, so you should not be intolerant towards others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes but they are sinning and we shouldn&#8217;t associate with sin.&#8221; Yes, we shouldn&#8217;t associate with sin but we are to love the sinner because they are prisoners are who are held captive in their sin. And you want to kick them out of their church? Where else can they hear of the God who actually saves? Check to see if your church actually preaches the gospel week in and week out. If your church doesn&#8217;t preach the gospel, then go ahead and remove such sinners from your church. Without the gospel of Christ preached, there is nothing for their souls there anyways.</p>

<p>So we can clearly see that bigotry is not part of the gospel. The gospel has no room for such sin.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to xenophobia which is defined as &#8220;intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries.&#8221; We have seen a hatred against people who are outside this country coming in and we use everything not Biblical to justify our stances. But to know and read the Bible is to know the heart of God for the stranger, the immigrant, the outsider, the alien, the lost. And God loves and cares for them and seeks out to find them and bring them home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span lang="en-US">“When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the </span><span lang="en-US">Lord</span> <span lang="en-US">your God. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Leviticus 19:33–34" id="return-note-3163-7" href="#note-3163-7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-US">“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. <a class="simple-footnote" title="1 Chronicles 29:14–15" id="return-note-3163-8" href="#note-3163-8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for those who say we no longer have to follow the Old Testament, I say this. Literally, this is the parable of the Good Samaritan <a href="#note-3163-9" title="Luke 25:10-36"><sup>9</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-9.simple-footnote}. Like, <em>literally.</em></p>

<p>In other words, we were once lost but now found. <a href="#note-3163-10" title="Luke 15:1–32"><sup>10</sup></a>{#return-note-3163-10.simple-footnote}</p>

<p>So we can clearly see that xenophobia is not part of the gospel. The gospel has no room for such sin.</p>

<p>So now we see that everything that Donald Trump has stood for—all around hatred—is at complete odds not with society with the gospel and against God himself.</p>

<p>So we can say with the utmost certainty racism, bigotry, hatred, and xenophobia are gospel issues because the Bible makes that painfully clear.</p>
