      <title>Believe, and Believe for Your Life!</title>

      <description>&amp;#8220;That sad and yet blissful hour when Abraham was to take leave of all that was dear to him, when yet once more he was to lift up his head, when his countenance would shine like that of the Lord, when he would concentrate his whole soul in a blessing which was potent to make Isaac blessed all his days–this time would not come! For he would indeed take leave of Isaac, but in such a way that he himself would remain behind; death would separate them, but in such a way that Isaac remained its prey.</description>

      <title>Dancing In Midair</title>

      <description>On those who possess actual faith in God:
&amp;#8220;It is supposed to be the most difficult task for a dancer to leap into a definite posture in such a way that there is not a second when he is grasping after the posture, but by the leap itself he stands fixed in that posture. Perhaps no dancer can do it–that is what this knight does. Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance.</description>

      <title>Dangerous Calling: God Will Give Us What We Want</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/quotes/dangerous-calling/</link>

      <description>Sometimes, we think of God as a pragmatic god. We think we do exactly as he says, we make it appear that all is well, and do everything to please him, he will give us whatever our heart&amp;#8217;s desires.
Wait, what if my heart&amp;#8217;s desires are for something not Him? What if I want more money, more sex, more work, more security, more of anything out of God but not God himself?</description>

      <title>I Cannot Close My Eyes To This Leap of Faith</title>

      <description>I have seen the dreadful before my own eyes, I do not flee from it timorously, but I know very well that, although I advance to meet it, my courage is not the courage of faith, nor anything comparable to it. I am unable to make the movements of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge confidently into the absurd, for me that is an impossibility … but I do not boast of it.</description>

      <title>I Would’ve Been Too Scared</title>

      <description>But what did Abraham do? He arrived neither too soon nor too late. He mounted the ass, he rode slowly along the way. All that time he believed–he believed that God would not require Isaac of him, whereas he was willing nevertheless to sacrifice him if it was required. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for there could be no question of human calculation, and it was indeed the absurd that God who required it of him should the next instant recall the requirement.</description>

      <title>Is Faith Knowing What’s Going To Happen?</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/quotes/is-faith-knowing-whats-going-to-happen/</link>

      <guid>http://theologic.us/quotes/is-faith-knowing-whats-going-to-happen/</guid>
      <description>Upon this pinnacle stands Abraham. The last stage he loses sight of is the infinite resignation. He really goes further, and reaches faith; for all these caricatures of faith, the miserable lukewarm indolence which thinks, &amp;#8220;There surely is no instant need, it is not worth while sorrowing before the time,&amp;#8221; the pitiful hope which says, &amp;#8220;One cannot know what is going to happen … it might possibly be after all&amp;#8221;–these caricatures of faith are part and parcel of life&amp;#8217;s wretchedness, and the infinite resignation has already consigned them to infinite contempt.</description>

      <title>Keeping Our Britches Lined With Footnotes</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/theology/keeping-our-britches-lined-with-footnotes/</link>

      <guid>http://theologic.us/theology/keeping-our-britches-lined-with-footnotes/</guid>
      <description>&amp;#8220;I will assert that serious theology cannot expect to get anywhere until we knock off the urbane silliness that characterizes so much theological discussion today. The Scriptures say the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; some have taken this to mean that unbelief and autonomous rationality must be the beginning of knowledge. In light of this, the ache that some conservative scholars have to be taken seriously in the unbelieving academy is a pitiful thing indeed, and so I would like to take this opportunity to give the whole thing the universal raspberry.</description>

      <title>Knowing τελοσ or Bust!</title>

      <description>Studying Philosophy, I am wrestling with the meaning and understanding of telos as in teleological arguments or teleology.
For several weeks, I keep running into the Gk. root _telos- _and for weeks, I had to keep looking it up on my iPhone to remind me what it means and more importantly, &amp;#8220;what the sentence is actually saying&amp;#8220;.
And the cement becomes bone-dry when I read this little quote:
&amp;#8220;Moses declared that the law was not too hard for Israel to keep.</description>

      <description>Abraham became old, Sarah became a laughingstock in the land, and yet he was God&amp;#8217;s elect and inheritor of the promise that in his seed all the races of the world would be blessed.

      <title>Loving God But Not Believing God</title>
      <link>http://theologic.us/quotes/loving-god-but-not-believing-god/</link>

      <description>If this had not been the case with Abraham, then perhaps he might have loved God but not believed; for he who loves God without faith reflects upon himself, he who loves God believingly reflects upon God.

      <title>Why Should I Live?</title>

      <description>I have lived my life boiled down to one simple quote: Nicolaus Zinzendorf&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;Preach the gospel, die, and be forgotten&amp;#8217; as to shine light on the meaning of 1 Corinthians 2:2 in my life. All of my studies and all of my toiling and to a much larger, unavoidable influence, the way that I love and live my life, are all wrapped in up that one little quote. It is a quote that I have mediated much on and it is a now philosophy I cannot let go.</description>
