      <description>Since the 2016 Presidential Election, I definitely regret many things. Most of which, the lashing out in anger against Trump, his Nazi administration, and his White Evangelical followers who empowered him.
But all of that anger and frustration is really all in vain. You see, for all of that energy spent, I have gain nothing. I have not done anything significant. Nothing has changed.
Nothing has changed because I haven&amp;#8217;t really been about anything significant.</description>

      <description>We confess the mystery and wonder of God made flesh and rejoice in our great salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord. With the Father and the Holy Spirit, the Son created all things, sustains all things, and makes all things new. Truly God, He became truly man, two natures in one person. He was born of the Virgin Mary and lived among us. Crucified, dead, and buried, He rose on the third day, ascended to heaven, and will come again in glory and judgment.</description>
