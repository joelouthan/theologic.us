      <description>&amp;#8220;The art of building intimacy comes from two people being genuine and then telling each other the truth. That is how we are going to be free. That is how we are going to build strong marriages and strong families: everybody has permission to be themselves around me and I get to be myself around everybody else.
What I am not saying is that everybody gets to be an idiot. It&amp;#8217;s not, &amp;#8216;you&amp;#8217;re ok and I&amp;#8217;m okay.</description>

      <description>I have lived my life boiled down to one simple quote: Nicolaus Zinzendorf&amp;#8217;sÂ &amp;#8216;Preach the gospel, die, and be forgotten&amp;#8217; as to shine light on the meaning of 1 Corinthians 2:2 in my life. All of my studies and all of my toiling and to a much larger, unavoidable influence, the way that I love and live my life, are all wrapped in up that one little quote. It is a quote that I have mediated much on and it is a now philosophy I cannot let go.</description>
