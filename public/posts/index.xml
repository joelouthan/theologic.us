      <description>Romans 8:38–39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
In the year of our 2018, we have Christians contending that their faith would be unshaken if the resurrection never took place.</description>

      <description>Psalm 73:21–26
When my soul was embittered,
when I was pricked in heart,
I was brutish and ignorant;
I was like a beast toward you.
Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
you hold my right hand.
You guide me with your counsel,
and afterward you will receive me to glory.
Whom have I in heaven but you?
And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
My flesh and my heart may fail,</description>

      <description>Mark 10:46-52 And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!</description>

      <description>Romans 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. All of the questions, pushbacks, and opposition that Paul was facing with teaching this one particular truth of God as a through but simple exposition of Christ’s own words when He said: I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.  My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.</description>

      <description>TRIUNE GOD
That there is one God, infinitely great and good, the creator and sustainer of all things visible and invisible, the one true source of light and life, who has life in himself and lives eternally in glorious light and sovereign love in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14) – co-equal in nature, majesty, and glory. Everything God does in creating, sustaining, judging, and redeeming the world reflects who God is, the one whose perfections, including love, holiness, knowledge, wisdom, power, and righteousness, have been revealed in the history of salvation.</description>

      <description>Ephesians 1:11-14 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.</description>

      <description>Mark 10:32-34 And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:36 As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” So what if a little “tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?” 1 comes our way? God promises suffering for his saints. There is no way around it. Just in case you are at odds with the rest of the authors of the Bible and only want the “red letter edition”, let us consider the words of Christ himself: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth.</description>

      <description>In Christ alone my hope is found,  Psalm 16:8–11 I have set the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure. For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption. You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:14-17 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</description>

      <description>Mark 10:17-22 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.

      <description>My Lord and my God, Even when I was dead, you called my name. Even when I was lost, you found me. Even when I was blind, you touched my eyes and opened them to see. Even when I was deaf, you opened them to hear. Even when I was hard-hearted, you took my heart of stone and gave me your tender heart. Even when I couldn’t know you, you gave me Your Spirit.</description>

They are not always going to do it with outright accusations, but they might resort to that. “Look at your life! Look at all the mistakes you’ve made!

But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.</description>

I could sit here and blast you with God’s holy words about God alone provides for us, and we need nothing. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 1 It is more than “I don’t want” like we are monks in Timbuktu living off the land but rather, because God adopted us, we are co-heirs with the One who has inherited all things.</description>

Give us this day our daily bread,

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? The love of God cannot be simply defined by the merest of affections and words that we might share with one another. Is our relationship to our spouse, children, family, co-workers, or neighbor compare to one’s relationship with God? Although our relationships should be held in the light of God’s relationship with us, it is perposturous to think that anybody we know would compare to God is perfect in all things especially when it comes to love.</description>

      <description>When I sin against thee I cross thy will, love, life, and have no comforter, no creature, to go to. My sin is not so much this or that particular evil, but my continual separation, disunion, distance from thee, and having a loose spirit towards thee. But thou hast given me a present, Jesus thy Son, as Mediator between thyself and my soul, as middle-man who in a pit holds both him below and him above, for only he can span the chasm breached by sin, and satisfy divine justice.</description>

To that end, predestination and glorification are things that our minds cannot fully fathom. But we rest assure that every single person predestined is called is justified is glorified. There is no whittling or dwindling of numbers as we move along the list, Christ said, “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</description>

Predestination is God&amp;#8217;s mere thoughts, affections, will, and decisions towards us. From eternity past, God thought of us specifically and was mindful of us intentionally.
Calling is the voice of God that actively makes us alive in our dead and sinful state. The calling of God is the voice of the Father bringing us to life and calling us according to His purpose.</description>

Throughout the Bible, starting in Genesis 2, God states that sin separates the soul of man from the spirit of God. And without God, we are dead. And just being dead is not enough: Ephesians 2:1–3 And you were dead in the trespasses and sinsin which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.</description>

      <description>The sea, dry land, winter cold, summer heat, morning light, evening shade are full of thee, and thou givest me them richly to enjoy. Thou art King of kings and Lord of lords; At thy pleasure empires rise and fall; All thy works praise thee and thy saints bless thee; Let me be numbered with thy holy ones, resemble them in character and condition, sit with them at Jesus’ feet.</description>

      <description>When God saved us from eternity past, His saving work was not finished when Christ lived, died, buried, and rose again, as though there is nothing for him for his people. You see, every single person born of man since Adam and Eve were born inherently not in connection with God but being apart from God both infinitely and eternally. That separation is because we have no spirit of God because our hearts were not born of God.</description>

      <description>Mark 9:38-41 John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not following us.” But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. For the one who is not against us is for us. For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.</description>

      <description>My Lord, You are the Prince of Peace. Where you are, there I find satisfaction of my wearied soul and find perfect peace where I can truly rest. Apart from you, I die and I perish. Away from you, I am only tormented by confusion and despair. Without you, there is nothing but destructions by my own hands and by everything around me. But you, O Lord, call me to enter through you and abide in you.</description>

      <description>And here is love: Romans 8:30a And those whom he predestined … We have now established that God loved us not just for the sake of love by itself. It is a warm and sentiment notion to be sure but when it comes to God, it is not just simply His love as though he can be reduced to one feeling. Likewise, while his love remains supreme, it isn’t all that he is.</description>

      <description>Let us muse upon the fact that Jesus was conducted without the gates of the city. It was the common place of death. That little rising ground, which perhaps was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, from its somewhat resembling the crown of a man&#39;s skull, was the common place of execution. It was one of Death&#39;s castles; here he stored his gloomiest trophies; he was the grim lord of that stronghold.</description>

      <description>This has been one of the most difficult chapters to write because there is so much to be packed into the doctrine of propitiation. The only way I could approach this is to start at the beginning and start at the high altitude and work our way down. To understand propitiation, we must understand God, his law, his love and his holiness.
What can incite the wrath of God? It is when we decide that we don’t need his way but we insist on own our way.</description>

And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.</description>

      <description>My Lord Above, I thank you for your perfect provision. You are my Good Father in heaven and because I am your child, you have always provided for me. When I was younger, I wanted many things but you did not provide them. But looking back, those things I wanted would have harmed me or cause me to turn away from you. But what you have always done is gave something even better, which turned out to be actually good.</description>

When we carefully walked through verse 29 of Romans 8, we saw that there was more than a few questions that rose to the top, namely: What did God saw in us?We now know that he didn’t see anything good, righteousness or lovely.</description>

      <description>This is the magnificence of the True God.
The God of the Old Testament who called down judgment on the wicked and the departed. The same God who expressed His faithfulness to His people who were faithless. The God whose steadfast love never ceased to those whom he promised would make things all things right. The infinitely powerful God who was able to always woo and pursue the hearts of his children and bring them out of death and destruction back into life everlasting.</description>

And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.  This entire series has been trying to pit the world’s definition of love versus God’s definition of love. And perhaps up until this moment, we have never taken that to actual task. What I mean by that is that comparatively speaking, if I speak of God’s love, we can still find something like that in on earth.</description>

      <description>Many people tried to say that the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are completely two different gods. Have you heard this argument? Why was God so angry? Why is Jesus so loving and kind? Was God in the Old Testament was the Father and then his Son took over in the New? I don’t understand a god that would punish people. I can only understand a god that loves.</description>

Philippians 2:13)&amp;#8221; is simply not good enough. Furthermore, to answer that &amp;#8220;the secret things belong to the LORD (Deuteronomy 29:29)&amp;#8221; is merely a copout to most people.</description>

My God, you are never far! You are with me! Always. While I might feel desperate or despair sadness or anger or happiness, you are with me and within me.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
There are many verses that can be used to aptly say what verse twenty-nine so succinctly and definitely says here. I can think of two passages:
1 Peter 1:20–21 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</description>

      <description>Now that we have established who we are in the sight of God, let us tackle the bigger, nay impossible question:
Who is God? Ask my son and he would immediately quote:
God is the universe’s Creator And Sustainer plus the only Savior, there is no one greater. He’s Triune, holy, omnipotent, omniscient, absolute, loving, sovereign and righteous are just a few of His attributes.

And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.</description>

My enemies are on all sides and their attacks are relentless, you are my protector.
When lions clamp down on my guts, you are the teeth-breaker and my healer.
When I am buried, you call me out of the ground.
When I was dead in my sins, you lived, died, and rose alive so that I might live.
You have never left me.
You have always been with me even when I did not know nor loved you.</description>

Herein lies love: all things work together for good for those who love God. Within our world, one might dare to ask, “What about those who don’t love God? What about my friend or neighbor or co-worker who is basically a good guy or gal?</description>

      <description>Before we can even try to understand what God has done in Salvation, we must first truly understand our condition as human beings born on this earth. I feel compelled to at least touch on this doctrine for I believe that many Christians sometimes either forget their natural state before God saved them or they simply don&amp;#8217;t remember being that &amp;#8216;bad&amp;#8217; of a person before being saved. It is not that we have to dwell on our depravity, our flesh, our sin nature but to ignore or forget about it would absolutely rob our heart of joy and worship before the Lord.</description>

And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.” And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.</description>

You say, “Speak of my love” and it falls on deaf ears. You say, “Speak of my power” and it means little to the strong. You say, “Speak of my glory” and their eyes remain blind.
However, you saved me. You made me with your hands. You are the one who started my heartbeat.</description>

But all of that anger and frustration is really all in vain. You see, for all of that energy spent, I have gain nothing. I have not done anything significant. Nothing has changed.
Nothing has changed because I haven&amp;#8217;t really been about anything significant.</description>

Thus in justification the heart of the Justifier and the heart of the justified beat in the most perfect and holy unison. It is not a stupendous act on the part of God meeting no response on the part of man.</description>

Romans 8:24-25 For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
What is this hope?
Walk backwards from the text. Our hope in adoption as sons? Redemption of our bodies? That creation would be set from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God?</description>

 They are thieves. They love to take your heart and never give it back. They love the Bible.  If you know me, I have many kids. But none of my kids had that spark, that interest&amp;#8230; that proclivity that these two girls had in the word of God.
From the moment, I met them I knew that I would give them every ounce of theological and doctrinal training, every note, every book, every podcast, every video that I had not just simply to raise preachers and pastors—although that is a small part of it.</description>

      <description>Mark 8:14–21 Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?</description>

      <description>Mark 8:11–13 The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.” And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Luke 24:44-49 Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.</description>

And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue.</description>

I could not begin to tell you what we were going through when we heard about you: death of my father, my grandmother, your Momma&amp;#8217;s grandfather, and the passing away of your sister, Olivia.
These storms and the pains that we were going through in our own heart and souls tested the mettle of your Momma and Papa&amp;#8217;s marriage and relationship and shook the foundation of our family to the bedrock.</description>

      <description>I will not attempt to explain way this atrocity. Similar to when our Patristic leaders had to make up words in order to explain the Incarnation of God, so too I will not do a disservice to Eric Garner&amp;#8217;s life by explaining away theologically.
  I will say this: this is one of the many countless ways that Christ came to make right. It&amp;#8217;s not good right now but Christ promises he will make it good.</description>

For so long, the gospel of God has been assumed in our churches. We now stand on the cusp of the gospel being denied from those who grew up in church and yet was never taught the fullness of the gospel and the full council of the Bible. Nevermind, the true gospel being scoffed at from the unbeliever&amp;#8211;we know that would happen.</description>

      <description>What is there to look forward to?
Romans 8:23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
My mother abandoned me when I was five years old and I never seen her since. My father physically, emotionally, mentally, and sexually abused me when I was a child. While I have “grown” physically, my heart and my emotional growth stunted to that of a child.</description>

      <description>Romans 8:19–22 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.</description>

Righteousness is when you are constantly, consistently, always perfect. It is continuous thread of how God is able to do everything: love, create, judge, save, redeem, rescue, glorify.

      <description>Romans 8:5-6 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
What is the flesh?
Is it something inherently evil? Is it that this body cannot do anything right?</description>

      <description>Romans 8:3-4 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
What is the law?
The world wants to look upon the Bible and see how hard it is to be a Christian.</description>

      <description>The Doctrine of Limited Atonement.
For those who are not familiar with this doctrine, it seeks to answer this question:
For whom did Christ die?
There are some points to ponder for sure but I have never seen anyone but old theologians wrestle with this question. (I couldn’t even name one New Calvinist who has grappled with this question—understanding the fact that my perspective is quite finite.)
In that context, I wasn’t sure if the polemic nature of John Owen’s work, The Death of Death in the Death of Christ, wasn’t somewhat outdated.</description>

      <description>Why haven&amp;#8217;t you read this book yet?
If I had to recommend just one book not including the Bible, it would be this book—above all other works and above all other commentaries. Many call Romans 8, &amp;#8220;The Mount Everest of the Bible&amp;#8221;. Martin Luther called it, &amp;#8220;the clearest gospel of all&amp;#8221;.
It is with this little paperback Octavius Winslow separates himself from the pack of scholars and theologians. I feel like it wasn&amp;#8217;t that Winslow had to explain the depth and weight of Romans 8 for the scholarly purposes but he had to write this book because if he did not, his heart would have burst in worship and love to our sweet God and Lord.</description>

      <description>My abusing and the abuse done against me.
My lies that I have told.
The wicked thoughts in my head.
My own foolishness.
My sickness.
The iniquities of my heart.
The lusts that captured me for most of my life.
The amount of pornography I have distributed in my lifetime.
My disobedience.
My distrust.
My blasphemy.
My anger.
The poison from my tongue
My hatred.
My self-righteousness.
My pride.
This what defines me.</description>

      <description>My life is not my own. My heart, my soul, my flesh, my mind, and my strength: all of it does not belong to me.
I used to think that it did belong to me. I use to the think that I was solely in charge of my own life, my own purpose, and my own destiny. But as the years rolled on, I noticed that the more and more that I tried to handle my life on my own, I was inching closer and closer to death—leaving a trail of destruction along the way.</description>

      <description>God loves us. So much so, He came to us.
The one who thinks of themselves as good or even, not-so-bad thinks that this is acceptable. “God should come to us. Why shouldn’t he? God should come to me and meet me and get to know me and love me and save me despite me.”
However, you see, to the renewed mind, the first line of John 3:16 almost doesn’t make sense.</description>

I am content.

This is Love, Election, Calling, Atonement, Justification, Propitiation, Expiation, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification rolled into one.
Even typing these words, meagerly and fumblingly, is drawing away from the sheer beauty, breath snatching, eye-rubbing gorgeousness, ever-swelling joy, tear-pouring grace and heart-bursting love that is this one verse.

**You make known to me the path of life;

&lt;p&gt;Every theology revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every doctrine learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any and all things processed were with Romans 8 in my sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard it said, &amp;#8220;The Epistle to the Romans is the Himalayas of the Bible and with Romans 8 is the Everest.&amp;#8221; Martin Luther calls Romans 8, &amp;#8220;the clearest Gospel of them all&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to memorize any passage of Scripture, it is because I wanted to get to where I can memorize Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any passage memorized now is because I am camped out on the summit that is Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorized it. Dwelled on it. Read about it. Focused on it. Prayed on it. Prayed using it. Recite it. Practiced preaching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write a multi-part blog series on the entirety of Romans 8 in a few weeks so I won&amp;#8217;t expand on it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, enjoy your view of God&amp;#8217;s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

Either I was a son of disobedience or I wasn’t.

I am confident that 99.8% of people reading this was born in the 20th century. Historically speaking, Christ died about 2000 years ago. I am going to link these two ideas in one moment.
Christ is fully God. That means He fully sees all and fully knows all.</description>

On the mount of crucifixion, Fountains opened deep and wide; Through the floodgates of God’s mercy Flowed a vast and gracious tide. Grace and love, like mighty rivers, Poured incessant from above, And Heav’n’s peace and perfect justice Kissed a guilty world in love.</description>

      <description>By God&amp;#8217;s grace, I heard this wonderful message shortly before I got married. When I first heard it, I got what Dr. Beeke was laying out but it seems to be too much. However, when I started a new family, it became crystal clear what I needed to do and that same weight became glorious. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)
You don&amp;#8217;t have to perfectly subscribe to what Dr. Beeke advised here.</description>

      <description>I still remember our first night of devotions. I was a brand new stepdad and barely getting to know my four new bonus kids, whom I loved so much. I was quite nervous because I had no clue how my kids would receive God&amp;#8217;s words. I prayed and God reminded me that He sends out His Word according to Isaiah 55:10-11. His Spirit through His Word gave me peace.
Now, it was time.</description>

loving Him with all my heart, soul and mind,
always on guard for myself that I maintain a testimony that is above reproach;
I commit to preach His Word,
standing ready in season and out of season,</description>

The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The LORD.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.” And the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leviticus 9:6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Chronicles 29:10-18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: “Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;**I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you shall bruise his heel.”**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God said to Moses, “I Am Who I Am” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I Am&amp;#8217; has sent me to you.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leviticus 16:21-22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sarah Leading Hagar to Abraham by Matthias Stom&amp;#8220;The parable, in Luke 18:9-14, was directed against those who thought they were righteous and looked down on everyone else. We need to place due emphasis on the phrase &amp;#8216;who thought they were righteous.&amp;#8217; People who preen themselves on their own righteousness go home unjustified even if they were baptized in a joint service with the pope and Billy Graham officiating. The self-righteous can trust in anything but Christ.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;That sad and yet blissful hour when Abraham was to take leave of all that was dear to him, when yet once more he was to lift up his head, when his countenance would shine like that of the Lord, when he would concentrate his whole soul in a blessing which was potent to make Isaac blessed all his days–this time would not come! For he would indeed take leave of Isaac, but in such a way that he himself would remain behind; death would separate them, but in such a way that Isaac remained its prey.</description>

      <description>ht: Jared Oliphant        &amp;#8220;Owen and his Reformed contemporaries did not simply equate the covenant of grace with justification by faith alone. Soteric benefits—whether justification, adoption, or sanctification—are appropriated in the context of the covenant of grace, and all are necessary for salvation. Yet because these benefits are rooted first in the person and work of Christ, the covenant of grace retains its gracious character.</description>

      <description>Then there’s the reality that holiness is plain hard work, and we’re often lazy. We like our sins, and dying to them is painful. Almost everything is easier than growing in godliness. So we try and fail, try and fail, and then give up. It’s easier to sign a petition protesting man’s inhumanity to man than to love your neighbor as yourself. It’s one thing to graduate from college ready to change the world.</description>

      <description>This study is important because exegetical fallacies are painfully painfully frequent among us—among us whose God-given grace and responsibility is the faithful proclamation of the Word of God. Make a mistake in the interpretation of one of Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s plays, falsely scan a piece of Spenserian verse, and there is unlikely to be entailment of eternal consequence; but we cannot lightly accept a similar laxity in the interpretation of Scripture. We are dealing with God&amp;#8217;s thoughts: we are obligated to take the greatest pains to understand them truly and to explain them clearly.</description>

      <description>On those who possess actual faith in God:
&amp;#8220;It is supposed to be the most difficult task for a dancer to leap into a definite posture in such a way that there is not a second when he is grasping after the posture, but by the leap itself he stands fixed in that posture. Perhaps no dancer can do it–that is what this knight does. Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;You see, sin is not first an intellectual problem. (Yes, it does affect my intellect, as it does all parts of my functioning.) Sin is first a moral problem. It is about my rebellion against God and my quest to have for myself the glory that is due to him. Sin is not first about the breaking of an abstract set of rules. Sin is first and foremost about breaking relationship with God, and because I have broken this relationship, it is then easy and natural to rebel against God’s rules.</description>

      <description>Here just the very small list of resources on Mark that I have found most helpful.
The Bible &amp;#8211; Should go without say. However, many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will &amp;#8220;cut straight to the chase&amp;#8221; and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author. Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.</description>

      <description>Some pollsters and pundits look at the worldliness of the church and conclude that being born again doesn’t make a difference in how people live. We should come to the opposite conclusion; namely, that many churchgoers are not truly born again.

      <title>Faith Replacing Works?</title>

      <description>&amp;#8220;_Fides salvifica_ receives all of Scripture as good news from a gracious God. In a general sense, all is gospel. But the Scripture does contain what might be called the Gospel proper, the good news of Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. This is why the Protestant scholastics also said that there was a _fides evangelica_ that specifically trusts in the revelation that God gives to us in the gospel of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</description>

      <title>Fanatical Christians Actually Haven’t Gone Far Enough</title>

      <description>Think of people you consider fanatical. They’re overbearing, self-righteous, opinionated, insensitive, and harsh. Why? It’s not because they are too Christian but because they are not Christian enough. They are fanatically zealous and courageous, but they are not fanatically humble, sensitive, loving, empathetic, forgiving, or understanding – as Christ was. Because they think of Christianity as a self-improvement program they emulate the Jesus of the whips in the temple, but not the Jesus who said, “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone” (John 8:7).</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;This book is a plea to embrace serious thinking as a means of loving God and people. It is a plea to reject either-or thinking when it comes to head and heart, thinking and feeling, reason and faith, theology and doxology, mental labor and the ministry of love. It is a plea to see thinking as a necessary, God-ordained means of knowing God. Thinking is one of the most important ways that we put the fuel of knowledge on the fires of worship and service to the world.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;The idea behind moral, therapeutic deism is that we are able to earn favor with God and justify ourselves before God by virtue of our behavior. This mode of thinking is religious, even ‘Christian’ in its content, but it’s more about self-actualization and self-fulfillment, and it posits a God who does not so much intervene and redeem but basically hangs out behind the scenes, cheering on your you-ness and hoping you pick up on the clues he’s left to become the best you can be.</description>

      <description>Wilson: &amp;#8220;God knew that we were going to need to pick up dimes, and so He gave us fingernails. He knew that twilights displayed in blue, apricot, and battle gray would be entirely astonishing and beyond us, and so He gave us eyes that can see in color. He could have made all food quite nourishing, but which tasted like wadded up newspaper soaked in machine oil. Instead He gave us the tastes of watermelon, pecans, oatmeal stout, buttered corn, apples, fresh bread, grilled sirloin, and 25-year-old scotch.</description>

      <description>In His righteous judgment, God has determined that the just penalty for sin is death and without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins. Now, sin has been committed by man and therefore only man can atone for that sin.
But here’s my dilemma: I can’t atone for my sin. I can’t.
I cannot satisfy God’s righteous requirement.
My disobedience condemns me before a Righteous God.</description>

My constant friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me. “Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear, And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears; Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; it is always wise to have a governing structure where the highest governing offices in the church and the highest positions of influence are open to lay people as well as ordained people. The denominations where only clergy have the highest of authority seem to be the ones that are never able to be brought back once they drift into liberalism because the ordinary lay people who have common sense and are reading their Bibles every day don’t have any way to regain control of a denomination that has gone astray if it has that kind of structure.</description>

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander, And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees. When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze. And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing; Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.</description>

I am unable to make the movements of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge confidently into the absurd, for me that is an impossibility … but I do not boast of it.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Jesus looks around at Peter’s fishing boat and tackle. Peter has gone back to the old life again, unsure what to do with himself next. Jesus says, &amp;#8216;Simon, son of John, when I first met you, you were a fisherman, and I called you to be a fisher of humans. You were very happy then to come with me and work alongside me. Now you are back here again. Do you love me more than these?</description>

      <description>But what did Abraham do? He arrived neither too soon nor too late. He mounted the ass, he rode slowly along the way. All that time he believed–he believed that God would not require Isaac of him, whereas he was willing nevertheless to sacrifice him if it was required. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for there could be no question of human calculation, and it was indeed the absurd that God who required it of him should the next instant recall the requirement.</description>

So really and honestly, the cruelty of God would be to protect you here and now in such a way that would rob you of eternal life into the 50-trillion-year mark and beyond.</description>

      <description>Nine times out of ten, every other story not in Genesis can be traced back to Genesis. (I logically suspect that that other one time is simply because I am a novice scholar.)
Forgive me as I do this off the top of my noggin but if I am not mistaken, all Biblical doctrines originates in Genesis in a very direct way. 1{#return-note-1105-1.simple-footnote}

      <description>This was the very first passage I memorized. I picked this passage because I heard this particular verse mentioned in a long list of other verses:
1 Chronicles 29:14 “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
When I looked up the verse and read it in context, I was blown away from David&amp;#8217;s commencement.</description>

When we truly see who we really are, we see our shunning of God’s wisdom; ignoring of God’s word; our turning away from His lovely face; our insistence to the crap the world has offer; our addiction to the pains and sickness; and our desires fueled by the love for ourselves at the increase of hate and apathy towards one another.</description>

Well, that was easy.

 Will you share with me some of the blogs/people you read? I love reading and being encouraged by deep thinkers.  Which, in turn, made me think: How did I get here? Why do I think the way that I do? Who has God used to shape my faith in Him, my knowledge of Him and my love of Him?</description>

If I have set the direction of my theology based on the thread of Hebrews 6:1-3, 1 Corinthians 3:21-23, and 1 Corinthians 2:12-13, then I would have to say this would be the basis for all of my reading, studying, writing, lecturing, preaching, and teaching:

      <description>The Prophet Jeremiah by Michelangelo BuonarrotiIn and around April 2007, I was saved. In and around May 2007, it occurs to me that I should start reading the Bible. I prayed and I felt like I should start with Jeremiah.
Every since reading Jeremiah, there were four truths that did a number on my freshly renewed mind (oddly enough, Jeremiah 29:11 was not one of them):

      <guid>http://theologic.us/scriptures/influences-love-song-psalm-119/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119 is the love song to God for all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/record_needle_body_203x152.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-964&#34; title=&#34;record_needle_body_203x152&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/record_needle_body_203x152.jpg?resize=203%2C152&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;203&#34; height=&#34;152&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It is the extended, smooth-out, quiet storm version. It’s the singer’s voice dropping to a bass-baritone. It is the passion towards the one the writer loves. It has the ultra-smooth whispers of sweet desires over the radio waves and the crackle of the vinyl in the extended beatdrop. This song is the mixtape track that says everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was made for one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is all about His righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psalmist is not in love with the law. The love was never directed towards a bunch of rules that they could never perfectly do. If I fail to do them all correctly, I have fallen. If I break one rule, I have failed. If fail to do one rule, then I separated from my precious love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I realized that there were some laws that supersedes my material reality, I have already failed. If I never realized the laws, then surely I have gone against my conscience and &lt;em&gt;seared&lt;/em&gt; my conscience from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damned if I do and damned if I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What hope do I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I have faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but I have love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have love for the One who did it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the King who wrote the laws and perfectly followed them to the letter. And my lawgiving King doesn’t hold His law over my head. Instead, He showers me with His banner of love over my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My King has me. He has it all. He just needs me to look into His eyes, hold his hands, and trust Him when He says, “Everything’s gonna be alright.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to lead a Bible Study. The very first book we studied through was the book of Ruth. Verse by verse. Chapter by chapter.
Given our group consisted of young adults, most of them were single, it was easy to quickly identify with, or want to be identified with, each of the key figures in this little story in the Bible.

      <description>I believe, trust, understand, love, and think by this principle: my entire grasp, knowledge, relationship, salvation, and love to God, for God, by God, from God, and through God is according to these three Scriptures:
Hebrews 6:1-3 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</description>

      <description>Romans 15:17-21 In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God—so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ; and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else&amp;#8217;s foundation, but as it is written, “Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.</description>

      <title>Is Christianity Good for the World? by Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson, A Quick Review</title>

      <description>Good, good, good, so good.
Wilson is top-notch and has the upper hand to give the response.
Hitchens is spot-on typical atheist:
 Remove God from the equation Plug-in Evolution as the new source Profit$  In this, the main hard-hitting topic was Morals and Ethics or the source of Morals and Ethics.
Wilson&amp;#8217;s explanation needs none here. Hitchens&amp;#8217; explanation is that there is no source but rather, our morals have evolved.</description>

      <description>Upon this pinnacle stands Abraham. The last stage he loses sight of is the infinite resignation. He really goes further, and reaches faith; for all these caricatures of faith, the miserable lukewarm indolence which thinks, &amp;#8220;There surely is no instant need, it is not worth while sorrowing before the time,&amp;#8221; the pitiful hope which says, &amp;#8220;One cannot know what is going to happen … it might possibly be after all&amp;#8221;–these caricatures of faith are part and parcel of life&amp;#8217;s wretchedness, and the infinite resignation has already consigned them to infinite contempt.</description>

      <description>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!</description>

      <description>For a tad over 300 hundred posts, I was able to keep this blog free from personal feelings and insight. I was doing my best to bifurcate my theological pursuits and the pursuits of the heart.
But over the last year, with the maturity of my emotions increasing, I am beginning to see that is an impossibility. To do so would be to go against the tagline of this site as penned by Samuel Rutherford: “No pen, no words, no image can express to you the loveliness of my only, only Lord Jesus”.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;I will assert that serious theology cannot expect to get anywhere until we knock off the urbane silliness that characterizes so much theological discussion today. The Scriptures say the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; some have taken this to mean that unbelief and autonomous rationality must be the beginning of knowledge. In light of this, the ache that some conservative scholars have to be taken seriously in the unbelieving academy is a pitiful thing indeed, and so I would like to take this opportunity to give the whole thing the universal raspberry.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;I sometimes wonder, my dear friends, if one of the questions—if one of the first questions—God would ask me at the day of judgment, as He assesses my life, is not going to be, &amp;#8216;How well did you preach?&amp;#8217; but &amp;#8216;What kind of father were you?&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;How faithful were you to the charges I gave you?&amp;#8217;. That&amp;#8217;s your first ministry, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Not to be using your gifts here and there, in the church, here and there.</description>

      <description>Studying Philosophy, I am wrestling with the meaning and understanding of telos as in teleological arguments or teleology.
For several weeks, I keep running into the Gk. root _telos- _and for weeks, I had to keep looking it up on my iPhone to remind me what it means and more importantly, &amp;#8220;what the sentence is actually saying&amp;#8220;.
And the cement becomes bone-dry when I read this little quote:
&amp;#8220;Moses declared that the law was not too hard for Israel to keep.</description>

      <description>In ancient times it was understood that there was a transcendent moral order outside the self, built in to the fabric of the universe. If you violated that metaphysical order there were consequences just as severe as if you violated physical reality by placing your hand in a fire. The path of wisdom was to learn to live in conformity with this unyielding reality. That wisdom rested largely in developing qualities of character, such as humility, compassion, courage, discretion, and loyalty.</description>

Before you were born, I would look at your beautiful, gorgeous mom and I would look at myself and kept thinking, “What is Elijah going to look like?” Most of all, what is Elijah going to be like—as a baby, a toddler, a kid, a teenager, an adult and even an old man. I was so curious about your life and all the possibilities therein.
I know this much to be true: I loved you.</description>

You are far more than what people see. Or as the saying goes, you are more than the sum of your parts. When people see you, they may see only your incredible beauty. And as wonderful as your beauty may be, your mind, heart and soul runs so much deeper.
This much I know of you: You are a scholar of the highest rank. Honestly, you are every bit the academic that I wish was.</description>

You know what I love about you? You are completely different compared to your other siblings. You are nothing like your brothers and sisters. Heck, you are nothing like any person I have ever met.
First and foremost, you are marked with intense amount of passion. For art and singing, I could talk on end about that but that is not what I am talking about. What I do know, see and feel every single day is your passion to love and to give love.</description>

      <description>Mark 1:12-13 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.
Was Jesus human?

Did Jesus have in him, the Spirit of God?
Do we have the Spirit of God?
Are we sons and daughters of God?

1. Is the kingdom of God right here, right now?
What is the kingdom of God? Is it like a country like the United States—does it have a location? Does it include all of the earth, all of heaven and all of outer space?</description>

And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.</description>

“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way,
the voice of one crying in the wilderness:
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,

500 years before Jesus came as a little baby, the entire Old Testament spoke of Jesus Christ.
Jesus said it himself:
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, Christ interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</description>

      <description>Mark 1:21-28 And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
Be confident in God&amp;#8217;s Word. If the Bible says it, it is as good as gold. It is as good as done. (See 2 Timothy 3:16-17)
And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit.</description>

Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.</description>

      <description>Mark 5:24-34 And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.</description>

      <description>Mark 5:35-43 While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler&amp;#8217;s house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.</description>

How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?</description>

And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</description>

He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. And he said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.

      <description>&amp;#8220;The goal of bringing ourselves or others to a true and sin-conquering knowledge of God will never be reached by instrument of logic alone. Jesus sent Paul on an impossible mission. He said to Paul, &amp;#8216;I am sending you to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins&amp;#8217; (Acts 26:17-18). This is what happens when strongholds are destroyed, and arguments against the truth of God are overcome and thoughts are taken captive for Christ.</description>

Like tonight: our family was having a robust discussion on dinosaurs. In my mind, I knew we would have no other opportunities to do devotions. This is how I transitioned into devotion time:
Me: NO ONE MAKE A MOVE. STAY IN YOUR SEAT. IT&amp;#8217;S&amp;#8230;

Yet, you transported from the spiritual to the material. You cut across space and time. You personally opened my eyes, gave words for my throat, opened my eyes, filled my heart, and gave me understanding so that I may know you.</description>

      <description>My Lord,
I am set apart, this is true. But set apart by you to you.
I reach out to the world, plead to the world, and with the Spirit, invite the world to come into Your loving embrace.
Few do. Many do not.
How can I respond?
You are my Lord above. You are my King on high. All things, both spiritual and material, are yours. All truth and all philosophies are under your sovereign hand.</description>

      <description>Lord, If I cry out for you, will you answer me? If you alone made the provisions and the sacrifices, will you save me? Even if I don’t understand you, will you reach for me? I need you, Lord. I don’t even have the wisdom to reach my hands up to you. I want you, God, and my heart is still filled with sin and wickedness. I have you, my Lord and my God, because I have your Spirit within me all because of what Your Son has done for me.</description>

      <description>My God,  In my finite perception, my circumstances would seem to say I am in despair. I feel that. I feel that onslaught. I feel that pressure.
Many would say, ”Ah, your God has failed. Your God is not good. Your God does not deliver. Your God does not save.”
They would be wrong on all accounts.
When I turn away from all of my oppressors and turn towards you, I see the loveliness of your face.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Have no fears then. Now that the common Savior of all has died on our behalf, we who believe in Christ no longer die, as men died aforetime, in fulfillment of the threat of the law. That condemnation has come to an end; and now that, by the grace of the resurrection, corruption has been banished and done away, we are loosed from our mortal bodies in God&amp;#8217;s good time for each, so that we may obtain thereby a better resurrection.</description>

But now He entered the world in a new way, stooping to our level in His love and Self-revealing to us.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;But how was He to do it? By the same means as before, perhaps you will say, that is, through the works of creation. But this was proven insufficient. Men had neglected to consider the heavens before, and now they were looking in the opposite direction. Wherefore, in all naturalness and fitness, desiring to do good to men, as Man He dwells, taking to Himself a body like the rest; and through His actions done in that body, as it were on their own level, He teaches those who would not learn by other means to know Himself, the Word of God, and through Him the Father.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Was He to keep silence before so great a wrong and let men go on being thus deceived and kept in ignorance of Himself? If so, what was the use of having made them in His own Image originally? It would surely have been better for them always to have been brutes, rather than to revert to that condition when once they had shared the nature of the Word. Again, things being as they were, what was the use of their ever having had the knowledge of God?</description>

      <description>[][1]The Course of Empire Destruction by Thomas Cole &amp;#8220;This great work was, indeed, supremely worthy of the goodness of God. A king who has founded a city, so far from neglecting it when through the carelessness of the inhabitants it is attacked by robbers, avenges it and saves it from destruction, having regard rather to his own honor than to the people&amp;#8217;s neglect. Much more, then, the Word of the All-good Father was not unmindful of the human race that He had called to be; but rather, by the offering of His own body He abolished the death which they had incurred, and corrected their neglect by His own teaching.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;The death of men under ordinary circumstances is the result of their natural weakness. They are essentially impermanent, so after a time they fall ill and when worn out they die. But the Lord is not like that. He is not weak, He is the Power of God and Word of God and Very Life Itself. If He had died quietly in His bed like other men it would have looked as if He did so in accordance with His nature, and as though He was indeed no more than other men.</description>

Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name! Psalm 97:9-12 </description>

Rachel Held Evans versus Douglas Wilson.
Supporters of Same-Sex Marriage versus Chick-fil-a and from my finite perspective, the rest of the Conservative Evangelical world.

      <description>The keynote in the mouth of every prophet-preacher, whether in Isaiah&amp;#8217;s day or Jesus&amp;#8217; day or our day, is, &amp;#8220;Your God reigns!&amp;#8221; God is the king of the universe. God is the king of the universe. He has absolute Creator rights over this world and everyone in it. But there is rebellion and mutiny on all sides, and his authority is scorned by millions. So the Lord sends preachers into the world to cry out that God reigns, that he will not suffer his glory to be scorned indefinitely, that he will vindicate his name in great and terrible wrath, but that for now a full and free amnesty is offered to all the rebel subjects who will turn from their rebellion, call on him for mercy, bow before his throne, and swear allegiance and fealty to him forever.</description>

God is aware of every event that has ever occurred and will ever occur, and he knows completely how each event affects other events that create still more events that roll into other events and so on and so forth ad infinitum. From the velocity of every butterfly’s flapping wings at every second to the exact amount of magma to the microgram flowing out of every volcano above and under sea level, he spans it all simultaneously and precisely.</description>

But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.</description>

For everyone who does any of these abominations, the persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people. So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs that were practiced before you, and never to make yourselves unclean by them: I am the Lord your God.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John 1:1-5; 14-18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will put enmity between you and the woman,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and between your offspring and her offspring;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&amp;#8220;The art of building intimacy comes from two people being genuine and then telling each other the truth. That is how we are going to be free. That is how we are going to build strong marriages and strong families: everybody has permission to be themselves around me and I get to be myself around everybody else.
What I am not saying is that everybody gets to be an idiot. It&amp;#8217;s not, &amp;#8216;you&amp;#8217;re ok and I&amp;#8217;m okay.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Every effort to account for the birth of the church apart from Jesus&amp;#8217;s resurrection flies in the face of what we know about first-century history and culture. If you don&amp;#8217;t short-circuit the process with philosophical bias against the possibility of miracle, the resurrection of Jesus has the most evidence for it.
The problem is, however, that people do short-circuit the investigation. Instead of doing the work of answering these very tough historical questions and then following the answers where they lead, they bail out with the objection that miracles are impossible.</description>

      <description>**2 Timothy 3:14-4:5 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</description>

      <description>Reflecting on the movie, Angels with Dirty Faces and the novel, A Tale of Two Cities:
&amp;#8220;I always found these stories of sacrifice very emotionally affecting. I came away from them resolving to live more courageously and unselfishly. I never did follow through on my resolutions, however. The stories moved my emotions and pricked my conscience, but my heart&amp;#8217;s basic patterns stayed intact. I was still driving by a need to prove myself to others, to win approval acclaim, to control what people thought of me.</description>

      <description>People are starving for the greatness of God. But most of them would not give this diagnosis of their troubled lives. The majesty of God is an unknown cure. There are far more popular prescriptions on the market, but the benefit of any other remedy is brief and shallow. Preaching that does not have the aroma of God&amp;#8217;s greatness may entertain for a season, but it will not touch the hidden cry of the soul: &amp;#8220;Show me thy glory!</description>

      <description>The other hidden premise in the statement &amp;#8220;miracles cannot happen&amp;#8221; is &amp;#8220;there can’t be a God who does miracles.&amp;#8221; If there is a Creator God, there is nothing illogical at all about the possibility of miracles. After all, if he created everything out of nothing, it would hardly be a problem for him to rearrange parts of it as and when he wishes. To be sure that miracles cannot occur you would have to be sure beyond a doubt that God didn’t exist, and that is an article of faith.</description>

      <description>Religion is not just a temporary thing that helped us adapt to our environment. Rather it is a permanent and central aspect of the human condition. This is a bitter pill for secular, nonreligious people to swallow. Everyone wants to think that they are in the mainstream, that they are not extremists. But robust religious beliefs dominate the world. There is no reason to expect that to change. Timothy Keller. The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism.</description>

When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.</description>

      <description>Careful handling of the Bible will enable us to &amp;#8220;hear&amp;#8221; it a little better. It is all too easy to read the traditional interpretations and invest them with a false, even idolatrous, degree of certainty. Because traditions are reshaped as they are passed on, after a while we may drift far from God&amp;#8217;s Word while still insisting all our theological opinions are &amp;#8220;biblical&amp;#8221; and therefore true. If when we are in such a state we study the Bible uncritically, more than likely it will simply reinforce our errors.</description>

      <description>1 Corinthians 1:20-24 Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</description>

When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace; In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil. His oath, His covenant, His blood Support me in the whelming flood; When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.</description>

      <description>I say to my non-Christian friends and neighbors, if you want to see the gospel of Christ, the gospel that has energized this church for two thousand years, turn off the television. The grinning cartoon characters who claim to speak for Christ don’t speak for him. Find the followers who do what Jesus did. Find the people who risk their lives to carry a beaten stranger to safety. Find the houses opened to unwed mothers and their babies in crisis.</description>

      <description>Holiness is written on everything in heaven. And nothing unholy can enter into this heaven (Rev. 21:27; Heb. 12:14). Even if you could enter heaven without holiness, what would you do? What joy would you feel there? What holy man or woman of God would you sit down with for fellowship? Their pleasures are not your pleasures. Their character is not your character. What they love, you do not love.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Yes, I have concerns. For example, I hope this book will help rescue the victims of evangelical pragmatism, Pentecostal shortcuts, pietistic anti-intellectualism, pluralistic conviction aversion, academic gamesmanship, therapeutic Bible evasion, journalistic bite-sizing, musical mesmerizing, YouTube craving, and postmodern Jell-O juggling. In other words, I believe thinking is good for the church in every way.&amp;#8221;

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, To every believer the promise of God; The vilest offender who truly believes, That moment from Jesus a pardon receives. Great things He has taught us, great things He has done, And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son; But purer, and higher, and greater will be Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;It is easy to think of other polarities under this heading that sustain relationships that are more complex yet. For example, the Bible urges Christian unity (think John 17), and the Bible insists on the non-negotiability of sound doctrine (think Gal 1), even if this means the most fundamental disruption of unity, namely, excommunication. The two desiderata are not quite parallel: one, the truth of the gospel, is always non-negotiable; the other, the virtue of unity, is often presented as something eminently desirable, but sometimes as an act of compromise (e.</description>

      <description>A faith without some doubts is like a human body without any antibodies in it. People who blithely go through life too busy or indifferent to ask hard questions about why they believe as they do will find themselves defenseless against either the experience of tragedy or the probing questions of a smart skeptic. A person&amp;#8217;s faith can collapse almost overnight if she has failed over the years to listen patiently to her own doubts, which should only be discarded after long reflection.</description>

All of my studies and all of my toiling and to a much larger, unavoidable influence, the way that I love and live my life, are all wrapped in up that one little quote. It is a quote that I have mediated much on and it is a now philosophy I cannot let go.</description>

      <description>More than ever I believe in preaching as a part of worship in the gathered church. Preaching is worship, and it belongs in the regular worship life of the church no matter the size of the church. In the small church it does not become conversation or &amp;#8220;sharing.&amp;#8221; In the megachurch it does not become hype and jingles. Preaching is worshiping over the Word of God—the text of Scripture—with explanation and exultation.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;In the 1950s and ’60s, rationalism began to erode evangelical scholarship, from academia on down, resulting in a liberal theology that crept into seminaries and churches. As a defensive maneuver, conservatives grabbed hold of the pendulum and swung it all the way over to the right side, wanting to believe they’d got “God” down to a science, his thoughts and ways explainable like mathematics. Romans 11:33 tells us instead that God is incomprehensibly immense, exceedingly expansive, and eternally powerful, and so much so that time and time again our response to many of the things of God ought to be “I don’t know.</description>

      <description>I was a hungry child
A dried up river
I was a burned out forest
And no one could do anything for me
But You put food in my body
And water in my dried bed
And to my blackened branches
You brought the springtime
green of new life
And nothing is impossible for You
_You have redeemed my soul
From the pit of emptiness
You have redeemed my soul</description>

      <title>“Ha, ha! Too Late!” said God never</title>

      <description>Modern people inevitably think that hell works like this: God gives us time, but if we haven&amp;#8217;t made the right choices by the end of our lives, he casts our souls into hell for all eternity. As the poor souls fall through space, they cry out for mercy, but God says &amp;#8220;Too late!&amp;#8221; You had your chance! Now you will suffer!&amp;#8221; This caricature misunderstands the very nature of evil. The Biblical picture is that sin separates us from the presence of God, which is the source of all joy and indeed all love, wisdom, or good things of any sort.</description>
