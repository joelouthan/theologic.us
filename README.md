**Note: Updated January 10, 2022**

## What it was

Back in January 2021, I decided to do a daily podcast that did a Bible Study on a book of the Bible. I began writing my first bible study on Romans right away in hopes of getting about two months worth of episodes.

Daily podcasts were a bit audacious. Silly me.

But out of that writing on top of the other theological writings I have done for the last decade was born another series.

## What is now

Here is Theologicus.

Daily devotions every weekday morning.

Bible studies every weekday evening.

If I am on vacation, podcasts will be put on pause while encore episodes on live stream.

## The Schedule

Live stream every weekday evening on [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us), [YouTube](http://youtube.theologic.us), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/462231051477464), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theologic_us) and [Afreeca](https://bj.afreecatv.com/theologicus).

Podcast on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/theologicus/) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0Xs5qsNvWePyRqcmtOTPkR) to post soon afterwards.

**Every weekday morning**: Home Devotions in the Gospel of Mark. What started as a devotional series for my kids is a devotional series to lead and share in your homes: with your spouse, family, parents, roommates, and best buds. This is not a series for me to teach you Mark but rather to equip you to do this yourself in any book of the Bible. Ask some open ended questions and let the Holy Spirit guide the discussion.

**Mondays**: Bible Study in Romans. What more can be said? I call Paul's Epistles to the Romans "the Systematic Theology of the ministry, preaching, life, death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ."

**Tuesdays**: What started off as Reflections (what is that?) and then Meditations (again, what is that?) turned into Gospel Meditations in the Pastorals which turned into the Gospel in the New Testament. Currently in the Pastoral Epistles of 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus.

**Wednesdays**: Doctrine… which all that means is the teaching of the Scriptures. Currently in the Westminster Confession of Faith.

**Thursdays**: I am not intentionally trying to do an Old Testament study because “Oh noes, I am doing too much in the New Testament.” I did want to include the other 39 books of the canon. And I was tempted to start off with Ruth or something easy peasy. But the more I prepared and prayed, the more it was clear that I had to do this study on Genesis. Even though I have written nothing formal about Genesis, here is what I do know for sure. Most of everything in the New Testament, especially in the gospels concerning the ministry of Jesus Christ, I can usually find it’s origins in the book of origins: Genesis.

**Fridays**: What I love about a set schedule is that it helps in deciding what is another series I could start. I have Bible Studies in the Old and New Testament. If I have Gospel in the New Testament, it would stand to reason that I would have the Gospel in the Old Testament. We start this brand new series with the prophet Daniel.

**Sabbath**: *We are moving to Kentucky by the end of February. I hesitate to call it this but this will be moved from a Bible Study into a liturgical home church on Saturdays which will be devoted to songs, prayer, Scripture, preaching, and blessing. This is until God leads us to settling into a local church. Please pray for us.*

## Not This

So what will this study be?

Here are some ways it will not be:

* **In-depth or technical** – Definitely nothing wrong with this method. This is not my strongest suit and I am really not here to impress anybody. I am just here to point you to Christ.
* **Time-Restraints** – Don’t be surprise if I have super short studies. Likewise, it might go long. I want to depend on God for that.
* **Boggled down in details** – When it comes to theology and doctrine, I have tried to abide in one rule, “Keep the main thing the main thing. Stop majoring in the minors.”

## The Goal

So how do we keep the main thing the main thing?

So glad you asked:

* **Devotional** – These studies are intended to be sweet time in connecting with God
* **Prayerful** – If done correctly, my intention is that the passage will mark, and then eventually, bath our prayers
* **Christ-Exalted** – All the Scriptures are about Jesus. This point will be driven into the ground.
* **Gospel-Centered** – Yes, this is an over-used term. But if the good news can be proclaimed, then we will absolutely preach that God saves sinners.
* **God-glorified** – This is not about your best life now. This is not about 10 ways to do something better. This is not try harder. This is not “I get to sin against God and he will look the other way.” This is about God and everything that He is and the promises He has fulfilled in Christ by the power of His Spirit.

## The Format

What should we expect from the show structure?

The format will be simple. Here’s a little template that I will be using

### The Text

What is the text we will be studying today?

### The Support

What, if any, other text supports what we are studying today? (If there is none, then we will won’t get bogged down.)

### God

What does the text say about God?

Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?

### The Gospel

What is the good news?

### Our Responsibility

What do we do now? Or as I like to say, “Where does God’s grace have me now?”

### Prayer

In the mornings, I will also be doing a prayer based on the Psalms. In the evenings, a simple prayer to God.

## Media
