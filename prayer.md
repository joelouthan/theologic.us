## Faith comes by hearing the word of Christ

>Romans 10:1‚Äì17 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Brothers and sisters, my heart‚Äôs desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation.

><sup>2</sup> I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.

><sup>3</sup> Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God‚Äôs righteousness.

><sup>4</sup> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes,

><sup>5</sup> since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them.

><sup>6</sup> But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, ‚ÄúWho will go up to heaven?‚Äù that is, to bring Christ down

><sup>7</sup> or, ‚ÄúWho will go down into the abyss?‚Äù that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.

><sup>8</sup> On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim:

><sup>9</sup> If you confess with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

><sup>10</sup> One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation.

><sup>11</sup> For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame,

><sup>12</sup> since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him.

><sup>13</sup> For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

><sup>14</sup> How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher?

><sup>15</sup> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.

><sup>16</sup> But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message?

><sup>17</sup> So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

## Request

Lord,

I pray that every single person in the Restoration Movement would be saved by You alone. 

Only You can do this.

I pray that everyone that is in Wilmore in this time will be saved and will be sent to a local church.

Only You can do this.

Lord, send faithful preachers to Asbury to proclaim your Son's great name, His great gospel, and His great love for us. For:

Only You can do this.

Let me see your glory!

Amen.

## One of the two witnesses

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
My God,
</div>
<br>

I absolutely do not know any better.

Could I be one of the two witnesses that prophesy for 1,260 days straight? I assume that is like straight through.

You have all the details. I love you, Lord.

Amen


><sup> 1 </sup> Then I was given a measuring reed like a rod, with these words: ‚ÄúGo and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there. 

><sup> 2 </sup> But exclude the courtyard outside the temple. Don‚Äôt measure it, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. 

><sup> 3 </sup> I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.‚Äù 

><sup> 4 </sup> These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 

><sup> 5 </sup> If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 

><sup> 6 </sup> They have authority to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague whenever they want. 

><sup> 7 </sup> When they finish their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war on them, conquer them, and kill them. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city, which figuratively is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 

><sup> 9 </sup> And some of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will view their bodies for three and a half days and not permit their bodies to be put into a tomb. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Those who live on the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. 

><sup> 11 </sup> But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, ‚ÄúCome up here.‚Äù They went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them. 

><sup> 13 </sup> At that moment a violent earthquake took place, a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake. The survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 

><sup> 14 </sup> The second woe has passed. Take note: The third woe is coming soon! 

><sup> 15 </sup> The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever. 

><sup> 16 </sup> The twenty-four elders, who were seated before God on their thrones, fell facedown and worshiped God, 

><sup> 17 </sup> saying, We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. 

><sup> 18 </sup> The nations were angry, but your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged and to give the reward to your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth. 

><sup> 19 </sup> Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder, an earthquake, and severe hail.

## 10:02

> Luke 10:2 (CSB) He told them, ‚ÄúThe harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.

<div style=‚Äòfont-variant: small-caps;‚Äô>
My God,
</div>

Open my eyes to see those far from you. 

Open my heart to love those who do not know you. 

Open my mouth so I would tell them your precious gospel. 

Amen.

> Abby‚Äôs dad, Mike. I‚Äôm not entirely sure where my dad stands, but know he thinks he has a relationship with God and his views are very influential in my family. He is a Christian Universalist and in my study of it have come to see it as an absolute heresy and false gospel. We have been able to have an ongoing discussion about it over email the past 2 weeks, so please pray that I‚Äôm able to stay humble and respectful in our conversation and speak nothing out of emotion but only truth. It has been going very well so far. Please, please pray! üôè
