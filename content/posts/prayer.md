## Repentance

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
Lord,
</div>

```text
I have seen my prayers. I believe that you have answered them. I see that you have changed my heart. I do not believe I have failed you. I know that I am obeying your will—​all because of what your Son has done for us.

Amen.
```
