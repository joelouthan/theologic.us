## Repentance

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
Lord,
</div>

```text
Do what you must so I would be conformed to the image of my Christ.

Amen.
```

## 10:02

> Luke 10:2 (CSB) He told them, “The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.

<div style=‘font-variant: small-caps;’>
My God,
</div>

```text
Open my eyes to see those far from you. 

Open my heart to love those who do not know you. 

Open my mouth so I would tell them your precious gospel. 

Amen.
```
