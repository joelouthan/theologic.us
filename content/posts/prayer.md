## Repentance

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
Lord,
</div>

```text
Do what you must so I would be conformed to the image of my Christ.

I ask for a double portion of your blessing and your spirit and your grace in order for me to preach your word and your great gospel.

Lord, please be in me. I open my heart and mind and hands and eyes and mouth. I cannot and will not do this without your mercy and grace upon me.

My God, give me a church so that I might preach your gospel there for all of my days and that I might be a herald for you in the midst of this town. 

Amen.
```

## 10:02

> Luke 10:2 (CSB) He told them, ‚ÄúThe harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.

<div style=‚Äòfont-variant: small-caps;‚Äô>
My God,
</div>

```text
Open my eyes to see those far from you. 

Open my heart to love those who do not know you. 

Open my mouth so I would tell them your precious gospel. 

Amen.
```

## Confession

Eternal God, in whom we live and move and have our being, we have sinned against you, and we sometimes forget your mercy toward us. **Cleanse us from all our offenses, and deliver us from proud thoughts and vain desires.** With lowliness and meekness may we draw near to you, confessing our faults, confiding in your grace, and finding in you our refuge and strength; through Jesus Christ your Son. Amen!

> Abby‚Äôs dad, Mike. I‚Äôm not entirely sure where my dad stands, but know he thinks he has a relationship with God and his views are very influential in my family. He is a Christian Universalist and in my study of it have come to see it as an absolute heresy and false gospel. We have been able to have an ongoing discussion about it over email the past 2 weeks, so please pray that I‚Äôm able to stay humble and respectful in our conversation and speak nothing out of emotion but only truth. It has been going very well so far. Please, please pray! üôè
