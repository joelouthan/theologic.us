I believe, trust, understand, love, and think by this principle: my entire grasp, knowledge, relationship, salvation, and love to God, for God, by God, from God, and through God is according to these three Scriptures:

Hebrews 6:1-3 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. **And this we will do if God permits.**

1 Corinthians 3:21-23 So let no one boast in men. **For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, and you are Christ&#8217;s, and Christ is God&#8217;s.**

1 Corinthians 2:12-13 **Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.** And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.

Here is the thread of logic I see here:

  1. Knowing God is by the will of God (Hebrews 6:3)
  2. All truth comes from God and since we belong to Christ, all truth is ours (1 Corinthians 3:21-23)
  3. For us to understand anything given to us by God, including and especially the free gift of salvation, it is by the power of the Holy Spirit. (1 Corinthians 2:12-13)

> &#8220;finitum non capax infinitum&#8221;

In other words, &#8220;The finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite.&#8221;

In his Introduction to his _[Systematic Theology][2]_, Louis Berkhof compared and contrasted the two realms of knowledge: Science and Theology. Science comes about because we can, in certain ways, control the subject of which we want to know more about. We can dig deep into the subject. We can prod it. We can expose it. We can cut it in two. What Berkhof contends is that what is true for Science is not true for God and hence, why we have true and proper Theology. In Theology, it is actually the Subject that controls, reveals, and enlightens how much we know about the Subject.

Could you imagine an ant determining how much or how little we know about the ant? That is a preposterous thought. But that is precisely how God reveals Himself to us: by His will through His Son by the almighty power of the Holy Spirit.  The root question now for our hearts and minds is whether we dismiss any theology and war against that very notion or do we humbly approach the throne of grace.

You might be thinking, &#8220;_If this is true, how can we know God at all?_&#8221;

Can we know _God at all_ or are you wanting to know _all of God_? The latter is not possible. Think about your spouse, your best friend, or your kids. You feel as you know them well but can you say you know all of your spouse or your best friend? God reveal Himself to us, in as we might not know _all of Him_, we can take full confidence that we can _truly know Him_ because we are His people saved by Him, for Him, from Him, to Him and through Him forever and ever.

In 1 Corinthians 8:1, Paul gives a small warning about this sort of knowledge—the knowledge of God and knowing God in order to love and care for one another. It is by this wonderful knowledge of God that can easily puff up our chests and create the wrongful desire that all people would come to you as the foremost expert on all things God as though you are some sort of priest and mediator between them and God. We can never be that because we have One Great High Priest and the Perfect Mediator in His Son, Jesus Christ.

But in order to rightfully guard against that sort of deceit and pride, we do not bring about that protection by increasing our ignorance of God. For God has said:

<pre><strong>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;
     because you have rejected knowledge,
     I reject you from being a priest to me.
And since you have forgotten the law of your God,
     I also will forget your children.
Hosea 4:6</strong></pre>

Whatever can we do?

Always know that God passionately desires you to know him truly and deeply—more true than you closest best friend a more deeply than the richest diamond mines of all the earth. In that, His heart&#8217;s desire, is that you would come to truly know His beautiful love for you and the untold riches of His grace so that your desire and love for Him would swell your heart and satisfy your soul.

I say all of this not because it has been perfected in my life. When God shown himself to me, I was grateful and in love. When He started to pour knowledge of Him in me, I became haughty and arrogant. Can we say that was from God? I would think not except the fact that I know one other part of His will for me: my sanctification. That is, He that began the good work in me will bring to completion on the faithful day I get to hold my lovely Savior&#8217;s face in my hands and get to kiss him ten thousand kisses.

That day has not arrived yet. But it will. Until then, I can do nothing else but trust in Him, love Him, and love others the best way that I can. So help me God.
