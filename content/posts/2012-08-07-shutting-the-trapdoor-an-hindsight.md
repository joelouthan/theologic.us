Rachel Held Evans versus Douglas Wilson.

Supporters of Same-Sex Marriage versus Chick-fil-a and from my finite perspective, the rest of the Conservative Evangelical world.

(Absence of links? I am too lazy to collect them for you.)

I have written opinions about these items and while I don&#8217;t necessarily regret my words, I wonder if my _voice_ helped, hurt or even worse still, contributed nothing to the conversation.

If I was completely honest with myself, I know that I contributed nothing and possibly hurt others in the process.

In my mind, I vowed to &#8220;**know nothing but Christ and him crucified**&#8221; but my heart&#8217;s idol-worship of my soul, will, and intellect betray me. I felt like I _had_ to speak up because I felt like I know more than others and my way is the best way. That is obviously and simply not true.

For whatever the next great Internet debate shows up, I think it would be best to keep my trap shut unless I am asked for my thoughts. When that time comes, I will pray for I am in desperately in need of God&#8217;s wisdom in order to think and His expert skilled hands to brutally kill off the pride in me.
