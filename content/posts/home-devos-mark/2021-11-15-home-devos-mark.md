## The Text

>Mark 6:30–44 (CSB)  
><sup> 30 </sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught. 

><sup> 31 </sup> He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 

><sup> 32 </sup> So they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place, 

><sup> 33 </sup> but many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them. 

><sup> 34 </sup> When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. Then he began to teach them many things. 

><sup> 35 </sup> When it grew late, his disciples approached him and said, “This place is deserted, and it is already late. 

><sup> 36 </sup> Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.” 

><sup> 37 </sup> “You give them something to eat,” he responded. They said to him, “Should we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?” 

><sup> 38 </sup> He asked them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out they said, “Five, and two fish.” 

><sup> 39 </sup> Then he instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 

><sup> 40 </sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 

><sup> 41 </sup> He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. 

><sup> 42 </sup> Everyone ate and was satisfied. 

><sup> 43 </sup> They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces of bread and fish. 

><sup> 44 </sup> Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.
