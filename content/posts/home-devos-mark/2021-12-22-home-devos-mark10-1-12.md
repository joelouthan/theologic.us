## The Text

>Mark 10:1‚Äì12 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> He set out from there and went to the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Then crowds converged on him again, and as was his custom he taught them again. 

><sup> 2 </sup> Some Pharisees came to test him, asking, ‚ÄúIs it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?‚Äù 

><sup> 3 </sup> He replied to them, ‚ÄúWhat did Moses command you?‚Äù 

><sup> 4 </sup> They said, ‚ÄúMoses permitted us to write divorce papers and send her away.‚Äù 

><sup> 5 </sup> But Jesus told them, ‚ÄúHe wrote this command for you because of the hardness of your hearts. 

><sup> 6 </sup> But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female. 

><sup> 7 </sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother 

><sup> 8 </sup> and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 

><sup> 9 </sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.‚Äù 

><sup> 10 </sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples questioned him about this matter. 

><sup> 11 </sup> He said to them, ‚ÄúWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Also, if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.‚Äù
