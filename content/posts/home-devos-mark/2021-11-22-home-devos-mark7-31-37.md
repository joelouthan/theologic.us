## The Text

>Mark 7:31‚Äì37 (CSB)  
><sup> 31 </sup> Again, leaving the region of Tyre, he went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis. 

><sup> 32 </sup> They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking and begged Jesus to lay his hand on him. 

><sup> 33 </sup> So he took him away from the crowd in private. After putting his fingers in the man‚Äôs ears and spitting, he touched his tongue. 

><sup> 34 </sup> Looking up to heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him, ‚ÄúEphphatha!‚Äù (that is, ‚ÄúBe opened!‚Äù). 

><sup> 35 </sup> Immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly. 

><sup> 36 </sup> He ordered them to tell no one, but the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it. 

><sup> 37 </sup> They were extremely astonished and said, ‚ÄúHe has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.‚Äù
