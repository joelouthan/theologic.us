## The Text

>Mark 8:14‚Äì21 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> The disciples had forgotten to take bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Then he gave them strict orders: ‚ÄúWatch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.‚Äù 

><sup> 16 </sup> They were discussing among themselves that they did not have any bread. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Aware of this, he said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you discussing the fact you have no bread? Don‚Äôt you understand or comprehend? Do you have hardened hearts? 

><sup> 18 </sup> Do you have eyes and not see; do you have ears and not hear? And do you not remember? 

><sup> 19 </sup> When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of leftovers did you collect?‚Äù ‚ÄúTwelve,‚Äù they told him. 

><sup> 20 </sup> ‚ÄúWhen I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you collect?‚Äù ‚ÄúSeven,‚Äù they said. 

><sup> 21 </sup> And he said to them, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you understand yet?‚Äù
