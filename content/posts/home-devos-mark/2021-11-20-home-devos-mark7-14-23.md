## The Text

>Mark 7:14–23 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> Summoning the crowd again, he told them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand: 

><sup> 15 </sup> Nothing that goes into a person from outside can defile him but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” 

><sup> 17 </sup> When he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. 

><sup> 18 </sup> He said to them, “Are you also as lacking in understanding? Don’t you realize that nothing going into a person from the outside can defile him? 

><sup> 19 </sup> For it doesn’t go into his heart but into the stomach and is eliminated” (thus he declared all foods clean). 

><sup> 20 </sup> And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. 

><sup> 21 </sup> For from within, out of people’s hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, 

><sup> 22 </sup> adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, self-indulgence, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. 

><sup> 23 </sup> All these evil things come from within and defile a person.”
