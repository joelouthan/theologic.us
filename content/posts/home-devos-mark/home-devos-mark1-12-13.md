## The Text

>Mark 1:12-13 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.

## The Devotion

>Romans 8:12-17 (CSB) So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh, because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

Is Jesus human? Is Jesus God? Is Jesus Son of God?

Jesus is fully God. In the beginning, he was in perfect relationship with the Father and Spirit. When Jesus became a human, he stepped out of that glory and into our reality. He did set down his glory to become man. Because he was fully human like you and me, he was completely affected by the same things we were affected--sickness, disease, loss, death, life, marriages, relationships, work, play--all of life.

>Luke 2:52 (CSB) And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and with people.

But in order to do what God came to do, Jesus would have to be filled with God.

Because he is the Son of God who became human, He was filled with the Spirit of God and led by the Spirit of God.

Because we are human and if we love and trust God, that means God has given His Spirit in us in order for us to go and do ministry.

If Christ did it, it would not be different for us.

## The Discussion

```text
1. What does it mean to have the God in my heart?

2. What first must happen for God to be in my heart?

3. What does it look like to be led by the Spirit? Do you think the Spirit will lead us where He led Jesus?
