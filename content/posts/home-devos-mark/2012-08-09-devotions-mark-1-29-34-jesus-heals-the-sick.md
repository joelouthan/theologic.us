## The Text

>Mark 1:29-34 And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
>
>That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.

## The Devotion

### Who made us?
  
>Genesis 1:26-27 (CSB) Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the whole earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth.”
>
>So God created man  
>in his own image;  
>he created him in the image of God;  
>he created them male and female.

### Were our bodies suppose to get hurt? Were we suppose to get sick?
  
>Genesis 1:31 (CSB) God saw all that he had made, and it was very good indeed. Evening came and then morning: the sixth day.

### Why do we get sick? Why do we get bad dreams? Why does our tummies hurt?

>Genesis 3:1-10 (CSB) Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You can’t eat from any tree in the garden’?”
>
>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’”
>
>“No! You will certainly not die,” the serpent said to the woman. “In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
>
>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
>
>And he said, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”

### Who comes to heal the sick and takes away the pain?
  
>Mark 1:32-34 (CSB) When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all those who were sick and demon-possessed. The whole town was assembled at the door, and he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.

All healing is God alone

### If you are healed when you take medicine, where did the medicine come from?

>1 Corinthians 3:18-23 (CSB) Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he can become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written, He catches the wise in their craftiness; and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile. So let no one boast in human leaders, for everything is yours— whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come—everything is yours, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.

If you are healed when you go see the doctor, nurse or even go to the hospital, where did all doctor and nurses' smarts come from? Where did provision to build the hospital come from? Where does science come from?

Only God.

### What if we die here on earth, do we still live?
  
If we trust, believe in Christ, we will live in perfect happiness with Him forever. That is faith.

>Colossians 1:15-20 (CSB)  
>He is the image of the invisible God,  
>the firstborn over all creation.  
>For everything was created by him,  
>in heaven and on earth,  
>the visible and the invisible,  
>whether thrones or dominions  
>or rulers or authorities—  
>all things have been created through him and for him.  
>He is before all things,  
>and by him all things hold together.  
>He is also the head of the body, the church;  
>he is the beginning,  
>the firstborn from the dead,  
>so that he might come to have  
>first place in everything.  
>For God was pleased to have  
>all his fullness dwell in him,  
>and through him to reconcile  
>everything to himself,  
>whether things on earth or things in heaven,  
>by making peace  
>through his blood, shed on the cross.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Have you ever seen God heal someone?

2. Where have you seen where God does not heal?

3. What does that mean when God doesn't heal us?
