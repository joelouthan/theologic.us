## The Text

>Mark 15:22-32 (CSB)  
><sup> 22 </sup> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of the Skull). 

><sup> 23 </sup> They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 

><sup> 24 </sup> Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, casting lots for them to decide what each would get. 

><sup> 25 </sup> Now it was nine in the morning when they crucified him. 

><sup> 26 </sup> The inscription of the charge written against him was: The King of the Jews. 

><sup> 27 </sup> They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and one on his left. 

><sup> 29 </sup> Those who passed by were yelling insults at him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 

><sup> 30 </sup> save yourself by coming down from the cross!” 

><sup> 31 </sup> In the same way, the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves and saying, “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! 

><sup> 32 </sup> Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe.” Even those who were crucified with him taunted him.

## The Devotion



Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
