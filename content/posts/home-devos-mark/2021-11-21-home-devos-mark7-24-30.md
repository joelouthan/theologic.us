## The Text

>Mark 7:24–30 (CSB)  
><sup> 24 </sup> He got up and departed from there to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice. 

><sup> 25 </sup> Instead, immediately after hearing about him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit came and fell at his feet. 

><sup> 26 </sup> The woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she was asking him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 

><sup> 27 </sup> He said to her, “Let the children be fed first, because it isn’t right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 

><sup> 28 </sup> But she replied to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 

><sup> 29 </sup> Then he told her, “Because of this reply, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.” 

><sup> 30 </sup> When she went back to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.
