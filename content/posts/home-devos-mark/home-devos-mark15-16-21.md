## The Text

>Mark 15:16-21 (CSB)  
><sup> 16 </sup> The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called the whole company together. 

><sup> 17 </sup> They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and put it on him. 

><sup> 18 </sup> And they began to salute him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 

><sup> 19 </sup> They were hitting him on the head with a stick and spitting on him. Getting down on their knees, they were paying him homage. 

><sup> 20 </sup> After they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his clothes on him. They led him out to crucify him. 

><sup> 21 </sup> They forced a man coming in from the country, who was passing by, to carry Jesus’s cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.

## The Devotion



Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
