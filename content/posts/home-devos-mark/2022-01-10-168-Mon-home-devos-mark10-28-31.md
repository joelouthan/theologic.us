## The Text

>Mark 10:28-31 (CSB)  
><sup> 28 </sup> Peter began to tell him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.” 

><sup> 29 </sup> “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said, “there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, 

><sup> 30 </sup> who will not receive a hundred times more, now at this time—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and eternal life in the age to come. 

><sup> 31 </sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
