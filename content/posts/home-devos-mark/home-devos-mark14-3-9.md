## The Text

>Mark 14:3–9 (CSB)  
><sup> 3 </sup> While he was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured it on his head. 

><sup> 4 </sup> But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has this perfume been wasted? 

><sup> 5 </sup> For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they began to scold her. 

><sup> 6 </sup> Jesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a noble thing for me. 

><sup> 7 </sup> You always have the poor with you, and you can do what is good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me. 

><sup> 8 </sup> She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in advance for burial. 

><sup> 9 </sup> Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
