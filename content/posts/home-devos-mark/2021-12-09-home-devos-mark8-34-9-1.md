## The Text

>Mark 8:34–9:1 (CSB)  
><sup> 34 </sup> Calling the crowd along with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. 

><sup> 35 </sup> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me and the gospel will save it. 

><sup> 36 </sup> For what does it benefit someone to gain the whole world and yet lose his life? 

><sup> 37 </sup> What can anyone give in exchange for his life? 

><sup> 38 </sup> For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” 

><sup> 1 </sup> Then he said to them, “Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.”
