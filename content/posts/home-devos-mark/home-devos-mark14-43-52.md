## The Text

>Mark 14:43–52 (CSB)  
><sup> 43 </sup> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived. With him was a mob, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 

><sup> 44 </sup> His betrayer had given them a signal. “The one I kiss,” he said, “he’s the one; arrest him and take him away under guard.” 

><sup> 45 </sup> So when he came, immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. 

><sup> 46 </sup> They took hold of him and arrested him. 

><sup> 47 </sup> One of those who stood by drew his sword, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear. 

><sup> 48 </sup> Jesus said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal, to capture me? 

><sup> 49 </sup> Every day I was among you, teaching in the temple, and you didn’t arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.” 

><sup> 50 </sup> Then they all deserted him and ran away. 

><sup> 51 </sup> Now a certain young man, wearing nothing but a linen cloth, was following him. They caught hold of him, 

><sup> 52 </sup> but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.

## The Devotion



Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
