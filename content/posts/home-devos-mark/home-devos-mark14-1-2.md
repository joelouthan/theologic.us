## The Text

>Mark 14:1–2 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> It was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a cunning way to arrest Jesus and kill him. 

><sup> 2 </sup> “Not during the festival,” they said, “so that there won’t be a riot among the people.”
