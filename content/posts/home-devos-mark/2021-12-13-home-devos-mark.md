## The Text

>Mark 9:14-29 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing with them. 

><sup> 15 </sup> When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran to greet him. 

><sup> 16 </sup> He asked them, ‚ÄúWhat are you arguing with them about?‚Äù 

><sup> 17 </sup> Someone from the crowd answered him, ‚ÄúTeacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak. 

><sup> 18 </sup> Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù 

><sup> 19 </sup> He replied to them, ‚ÄúYou unbelieving generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.‚Äù 

><sup> 20 </sup> So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 

><sup> 21 </sup> ‚ÄúHow long has this been happening to him?‚Äù Jesus asked his father. ‚ÄúFrom childhood,‚Äù he said. 

><sup> 22 </sup> ‚ÄúAnd many times it has thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.‚Äù 

><sup> 23 </sup> Jesus said to him, ‚Äú¬†‚ÄòIf you can‚Äô? Everything is possible for the one who believes.‚Äù 

><sup> 24 </sup> Immediately the father of the boy cried out, ‚ÄúI do believe; help my unbelief!‚Äù 

><sup> 25 </sup> When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, ‚ÄúYou mute and deaf spirit, I command you: Come out of him and never enter him again.‚Äù 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then it came out, shrieking and throwing him into terrible convulsions. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù 

><sup> 27 </sup> But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up. 

><sup> 28 </sup> After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt we drive it out?‚Äù 

><sup> 29 </sup> And he told them, ‚ÄúThis kind can come out by nothing but prayer.‚Äù
