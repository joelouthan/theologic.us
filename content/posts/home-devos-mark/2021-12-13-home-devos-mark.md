## The Text

>Mark 9:14-29 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing with them. 

><sup> 15 </sup> When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran to greet him. 

><sup> 16 </sup> He asked them, ‚ÄúWhat are you arguing with them about?‚Äù 

><sup> 17 </sup> Someone from the crowd answered him, ‚ÄúTeacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak. 

><sup> 18 </sup> Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù 

><sup> 19 </sup> He replied to them, ‚ÄúYou unbelieving generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.‚Äù 

><sup> 20 </sup> So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 

><sup> 21 </sup> ‚ÄúHow long has this been happening to him?‚Äù Jesus asked his father. ‚ÄúFrom childhood,‚Äù he said. 

><sup> 22 </sup> ‚ÄúAnd many times it has thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.‚Äù 

><sup> 23 </sup> Jesus said to him, ‚Äú¬†‚ÄòIf you can‚Äô? Everything is possible for the one who believes.‚Äù 

><sup> 24 </sup> Immediately the father of the boy cried out, ‚ÄúI do believe; help my unbelief!‚Äù 

><sup> 25 </sup> When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, ‚ÄúYou mute and deaf spirit, I command you: Come out of him and never enter him again.‚Äù 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then it came out, shrieking and throwing him into terrible convulsions. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù 

><sup> 27 </sup> But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up. 

><sup> 28 </sup> After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt we drive it out?‚Äù 

><sup> 29 </sup> And he told them, ‚ÄúThis kind can come out by nothing but prayer.‚Äù 

## The Devotion

Our faith is not born of us. There is not a little goodness in everybody born of Adam and if we do the right things and are convinced in the right way, that we can tend to that little goodness in our hearts like a fire and build it up.

As much as we want to take the credit for our faith and belief in Christ, we cannot. We do not receive the glory and honor and the completed tasks check-off in putting our hope, trust, and obedience in the son of God.

We have overly established on this channel using the books of Mark, Romans, Genesis, 1 & 2 Timothy with passages supporting from passages from every book of the Bible (with the exception of 2 Kings, Esther most of the Minor Prophets--fixed coming in March--2 Thessalonians, 2 & 3 John) that your believe cannot start and be born with you,
