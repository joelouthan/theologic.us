## The Text

>Mark 9:33-37 (CSB)  
><sup> 33 </sup> They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, ‚ÄúWhat were you arguing about on the way?‚Äù 

><sup> 34 </sup> But they were silent, because on the way they had been arguing with one another about who was the greatest. 

><sup> 35 </sup> Sitting down, he called the Twelve and said to them, ‚ÄúIf anyone wants to be first, he must be last and servant of all.‚Äù 

><sup> 36 </sup> He took a child, had him stand among them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, 

><sup> 37 </sup> ‚ÄúWhoever welcomes one little child such as this in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but him who sent me.‚Äù
