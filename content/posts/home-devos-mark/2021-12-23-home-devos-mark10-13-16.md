## The Text

>Mark 10:13–16 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. 

><sup> 14 </sup> When Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 

><sup> 16 </sup> After taking them in his arms, he laid his hands on them and blessed them.
