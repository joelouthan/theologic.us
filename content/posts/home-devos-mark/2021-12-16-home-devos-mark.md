## The Text

>Mark 9:38-41 (CSB)  
><sup> 38 </sup> John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he wasn’t following us.” 

><sup> 39 </sup> “Don’t stop him,” said Jesus, “because there is no one who will perform a miracle in my name who can soon afterward speak evil of me. 

><sup> 40 </sup> For whoever is not against us is for us. 

><sup> 41 </sup> And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ—truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.
