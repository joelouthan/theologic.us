## The Text

>Mark 2:1-12 (CSB) When he entered Capernaum again after some days, it was reported that he was at home. So many people gathered together that there was no more room, not even in the doorway, and he was speaking the word to them. They came to him bringing a paralytic, carried by four of them. Since they were not able to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and after digging through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying. Seeing their faith, Jesus told the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
>
>But some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts: “Why does he speak like this? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
>
>Right away Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were thinking like this within themselves and said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat, and walk’? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he told the paralytic— “I tell you: get up, take your mat, and go home.”
>
>Immediately he got up, took the mat, and went out in front of everyone. As a result, they were all astounded and gave glory to God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

## The Devotion

### Can God truly forgive us? Can we be truly healed?

The cross of Christ is the power to forgive sin and cure our diseases
  
>Isaiah 53:4-6 (CSB)  
>Yet he himself bore our sicknesses,  
>and he carried our pains;  
>but we in turn regarded him stricken,  
>struck down by God, and afflicted.  
>But he was pierced because of our rebellion,  
>crushed because of our iniquities;  
>punishment for our peace was on him,  
>and we are healed by his wounds.  
>We all went astray like sheep;  
>we all have turned to our own way;  
>and the LORD has punished him  
>for the iniquity of us all.

### When God completely removes our sin and we are with God for all of eternity, can we be hurt or sick again? Can we die again?

>Isaiah 25:8 (CSB)  
>When he has swallowed up death once and for all,  
>the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears  
>from every face  
>and remove his people’s disgrace  
>from the whole earth,  
>for the LORD has spoken.

### What has sin done to our lives? What has sin done to life?

>Romans 6:23a (CSB) For the wages of sin is death...

### What will Christ end up doing in order to forgive us of our sins?

>Romans 3:21-26 (CSB) But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

>Hebrews 9:22 - 10:18 (CSB) According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
>
>Therefore, it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these. For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model of the true one) but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God for us. He did not do this to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another. Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment— so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
>
>Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the reality itself of those things, it can never perfect the worshipers by the same sacrifices they continually offer year after year. Otherwise, wouldn’t they have stopped being offered, since the worshipers, purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
>
>Therefore, as he was coming into the world, he said:  
>You did not desire sacrifice and offering,  
>but you prepared a body for me.  
>You did not delight  
>in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.  
>Then I said, “See—  
>it is written about me  
>in the scroll—  
>I have come to do your will, God.”
>
>After he says above, You did not desire or delight in sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings and sin offerings (which are offered according to the law), he then says, See, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first to establish the second. By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.
>
>Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins. But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. He is now waiting until his enemies are made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after he says:
>
>This is the covenant I will make with them  
>after those days,  
>the Lord says,  
>I will put my laws on their hearts  
>and write them on their minds,  
>andI will never again remember  
>their sins and their lawless acts.  
>
>Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.

## The Discussion

What must I do to be saved?

Acts 16:25-34 (CSB) About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the jail were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s chains came loose. When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open, he drew his sword and was going to kill himself, since he thought the prisoners had escaped.

But Paul called out in a loud voice, “Don’t harm yourself, because we’re all here!”

The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. He escorted them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”

They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” And they spoke the word of the Lord to him along with everyone in his house. He took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds. Right away he and all his family were baptized. He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had come to believe in God with his entire household.

Romans 6:23 (CSB) For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
