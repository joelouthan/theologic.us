## The Text

>Mark 10:46-52 (CSB) 
><sup> 46 </sup> They came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. 

><sup> 47 </sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 

><sup> 48 </sup> Many warned him to keep quiet, but he was crying out all the more, “Have mercy on me, Son of David!” 

><sup> 49 </sup> Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage! Get up; he’s calling for you.” 

><sup> 50 </sup> He threw off his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus. 

><sup> 51 </sup> Then Jesus answered him, “What do you want me to do for you?” “Rabboni,” the blind man said to him, “I want to see.” 

><sup> 52 </sup> Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has saved you.” Immediately he could see and began to follow Jesus on the road.
