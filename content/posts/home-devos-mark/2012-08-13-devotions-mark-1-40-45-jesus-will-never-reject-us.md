## The Text

>Mark 1:40-45 And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, ‚ÄúIf you will, you can make me clean.‚Äù Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, ‚ÄúI will; be clean.‚Äù And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him, ‚ÄúSee that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.‚Äù But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.

## The Devotion

### Jesus calls us not as good people but as sinners

>Mark 2:16-17 (CSB) When the scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, ‚ÄúWhy does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?‚Äù
>
>When Jesus heard this, he told them, ‚ÄúIt is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn‚Äôt come to call the righteous, but sinners.‚Äù

>Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

### What will happen if you go to God and ask for God?

>Luke 11:5-13 (CSB) He also said to them, ‚ÄúSuppose one of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‚ÄòFriend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I don‚Äôt have anything to offer him.‚Äô Then he will answer from inside and say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt bother me! The door is already locked, and my children and I have gone to bed. I can‚Äôt get up to give you anything.‚Äô I tell you, even though he won‚Äôt get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his friend‚Äôs shameless boldness, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
>
>‚ÄúSo I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?‚Äù

In other words, if we come to God, pray to God, ask God for God, he will always, completely, perfectly give us Himself.

No exception.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Did Jesus want to heal the leper?

2. If we are sick, or we have done something wrong, will Jesus ever say, "No, I will not" or will he say, "Yes, I will heal you. Yes I will forgive your sins."?

3. What was Jesus sent to Earth to do? Was it heal every single person or did he have a bigger plan? What do you think that bigger plan was?
