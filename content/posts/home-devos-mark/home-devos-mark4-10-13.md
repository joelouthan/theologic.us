## The Text

>Mark 4:10–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 10 </sup> When he was alone, those around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. 

><sup> 11 </sup> He answered them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables 

><sup> 12 </sup> so that they may indeed look, and yet not perceive; they may indeed listen, and yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back and be forgiven.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> Then he said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand all of the parables?

```

>John 20:21-23 (CSB) Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.” 22 After saying this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”

5. When do you think when we finally understood Jesus?
```

>Acts 2:1-4 (CSB) When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying. 3 They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and rested on each one of them. 4 Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them.
