## The Text

>Mark 4:10–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 10 </sup> When he was alone, those around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. 

><sup> 11 </sup> He answered them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables 

><sup> 12 </sup> so that they may indeed look, and yet not perceive; they may indeed listen, and yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back and be forgiven.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> Then he said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand all of the parables?

## The Devotion



## The Discussion

```text
1. How do you learn in school?

2. Do you think it is the same way you learn about God?
```

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

```text
3. Do you think Jesus was calling his disciples stupid?

4. When do think the disciples finally understood Jesus?
```

>John 20:21-23 (CSB) Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.” 22 After saying this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”

```text
5. When do you think when we finally understood Jesus?
```

>Acts 2:1-4 (CSB) When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying. 3 They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and rested on each one of them. 4 Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them.
