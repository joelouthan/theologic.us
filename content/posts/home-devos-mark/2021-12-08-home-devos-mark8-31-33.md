## The Text

>Mark 8:31–33 (CSB)  
><sup> 31 </sup> Then he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and rise after three days. 

><sup> 32 </sup> He spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 

><sup> 33 </sup> But turning around and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! You are not thinking about God’s concerns but human concerns.”
