## The Text

>Mark 10:17–22 (CSB)  
><sup> 17 </sup> As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt down before him, and asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 

><sup> 18 </sup> “Why do you call me good?” Jesus asked him. “No one is good except God alone. 

><sup> 19 </sup> You know the commandments: Do not murder; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not defraud; honor your father and mother.” 

><sup> 20 </sup> He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth.” 

><sup> 21 </sup> Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” 

><sup> 22 </sup> But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.
