## The Text

>Mark 9:2‚Äì13 (CSB)  
><sup> 2 </sup> After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain by themselves to be alone. He was transfigured in front of them, 

><sup> 3 </sup> and his clothes became dazzling‚Äîextremely white as no launderer on earth could whiten them. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 

><sup> 5 </sup> Peter said to Jesus, ‚ÄúRabbi, it‚Äôs good for us to be here. Let‚Äôs set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah‚Äù‚Äî

><sup> 6 </sup> because he did not know what to say, since they were terrified. 

><sup> 7 </sup> A cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud: ‚ÄúThis is my beloved Son; listen to him!‚Äù 

><sup> 8 </sup> Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. 

><sup> 9 </sup> As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 

><sup> 10 </sup> They kept this word to themselves, questioning what ‚Äúrising from the dead‚Äù meant. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhy do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?‚Äù 

><sup> 12 </sup> ‚ÄúElijah does come first and restores all things,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWhy then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be treated with contempt? 

><sup> 13 </sup> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they pleased to him, just as it is written about him.‚Äù
