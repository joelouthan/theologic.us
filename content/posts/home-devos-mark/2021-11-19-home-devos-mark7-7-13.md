## The Text

>Mark 7:7–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 7 </sup> They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines human commands. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Abandoning the command of God, you hold on to human tradition.” 

><sup> 9 </sup> He also said to them, “You have a fine way of invalidating God’s command in order to set up your tradition! 

><sup> 10 </sup> For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death. 

><sup> 11 </sup> But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother: Whatever benefit you might have received from me is corban’ ” (that is, an offering devoted to God), 

><sup> 12 </sup> “you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 

><sup> 13 </sup> You nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other similar things.”

## The Devotion

### His word was in the beginning

>John 1:1-3 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.

### His word created everything

>Hebrews 11:1-3 (CSB) Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. 2 For by this our ancestors were approved. 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.

### His word is the examination of our hearts



### His word 



### His word 



### His word is hidden in the hearts of his people

>Psalms 119:9-11 (CSB) How can a young man keep his way pure?
By keeping your word.
10 I have sought you with all my heart;
don’t let me wander from your commands.
11 I have treasured your word in my heart
so that I may not sin against you.



>Psalms 119:9-11 (CSB) How can a young man keep his way pure?
By keeping your word.
10 I have sought you with all my heart;
don’t let me wander from your commands.
11 I have treasured your word in my heart
so that I may not sin against you.
