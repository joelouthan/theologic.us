## The Text

>Mark 7:7–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 7 </sup> They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines human commands. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Abandoning the command of God, you hold on to human tradition.” 

><sup> 9 </sup> He also said to them, “You have a fine way of invalidating God’s command in order to set up your tradition! 

><sup> 10 </sup> For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death. 

><sup> 11 </sup> But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother: Whatever benefit you might have received from me is corban’ ” (that is, an offering devoted to God), 

><sup> 12 </sup> “you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 

><sup> 13 </sup> You nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other similar things.”

## The Devotion

### His spoken word was in the beginning

>Genesis 1:1-3 (CSB) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

>John 1:1-3 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.

### His spoken word created everything

>Hebrews 11:1-3 (CSB) Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. 2 For by this our ancestors were approved. 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.

### His spoken word is perfect

>Psalm 19:7–10 (CSB)  
> 7  The instruction of the LORD is perfect, renewing one’s life; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise. 

> 8  The precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up. 

> 9  The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are reliable and altogether righteous. 

> 10  They are more desirable than gold— than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey dripping from a honeycomb.

### His spoken word is the examination of our hearts

>Romans 7:7-8 (CSB) What should we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But I would not have known sin if it were not for the law. For example, I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, Do not covet. 8 And sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind. For apart from the law sin is dead.

### His spoken word is filled with power

>Isaiah 55:11 (CSB) so my word that comes from my mouth
will not return to me empty,
but it will accomplish what I please
and will prosper in what I send it to do.”

### His spoken word is how we are saved

>Romans 10:14-17 (CSB) 14 How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? 15 And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. 16 But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? 17 So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

### His spoken word is hidden in the hearts of his people

>Psalms 119:9-11 (CSB) How can a young man keep his way pure?
By keeping your word.
10 I have sought you with all my heart;
don’t let me wander from your commands.
11 I have treasured your word in my heart
so that I may not sin against you.

## The Discussion

```text
1. What is above the word and law of God?
```

```text
2. What is another word for the law of God?
```

```text
3. What does it mean for the word of God to be authoritative?
```

```text
4. For some Christians, declaring the Bible to be authoritative is a difficult premise to agree to? Why do you think that is?
```

```text
5. If the Bible is not authoritative in our lives, then what is?
```

```text
6. Some may answer, 'God'. But what is the primary way that God speaks?
```

## The Prayer

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
The Living Word
</div>

```text
We bless your name upon the earth.

We pray to hide your word in our hearts.

But we pray that we will be kept in your word.

Forever and always.

We are your children. Speak to us, Father.

We love you.

Amen.
```
