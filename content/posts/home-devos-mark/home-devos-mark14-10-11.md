## The Text

>Mark 14:10â€“11 (CSB)  
><sup> 10 </sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 

><sup> 11 </sup> And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he started looking for a good opportunity to betray him.

## The Devotion

Christ's death was not staged. The people of this time were not actors. They were real humans with real emotions, wills, minds, and desires. For all the good that Christ brought--which was the salvation of his people--most rejected. Even those who were born as a Hebrew:

>John 1:11 (CSB)  He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.

Judas, who walked and ministered with Jesus. Who preached and cast out demons with the rest of the disciples. Who was there for nearly all of the works and preaching of Christ, sought to betray our Christ in the end.

There are times that you are going to be betray by a friend, family, or loved one--someone whom you love and you thought they loved you. And for sinful reasons, they turn their back on you, worked against you, deserted you and left you by yourself alone to defend yourself by yourself. That is betrayal. 

Christ knew how this felt. He felt this unto death. No one wants to betrayed--not even Christ. But taking on the sin of the world to the cross--but everything that must come with it: the shame, the guilt, the suffering, the hurt, the breaking of the heart of Christ.

But Jesus did it all. He had to in order to save you and me.

Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
