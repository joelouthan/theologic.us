## The Text

>Mark 15:42–47 (CSB)  
><sup>42</sup> When it was already evening, because it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath), 

><sup>43</sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came and boldly went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. 

><sup>44</sup> Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had already died. 

><sup>45</sup> When he found out from the centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph. 

><sup>46</sup> After he bought some linen cloth, Joseph took him down and wrapped him in the linen. Then he laid him in a tomb cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb. 

><sup>47</sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where he was laid.

## The Devotion



Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
