## The Text

>Mark 13:28–37 (CSB)  
><sup> 28 </sup> “Learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. 

><sup> 29 </sup> In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognize that he is near—at the door. 

><sup> 30 </sup> “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place. 

><sup> 31 </sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 

><sup> 32 </sup> “Now concerning that day or hour no one knows—neither the angels in heaven nor the Son—but only the Father. 

><sup> 33 </sup> “Watch! Be alert! For you don’t know when the time is coming. 

><sup> 34 </sup> “It is like a man on a journey, who left his house, gave authority to his servants, gave each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to be alert. 

><sup> 35 </sup> Therefore be alert, since you don’t know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening or at midnight or at the crowing of the rooster or early in the morning. 

><sup> 36 </sup> Otherwise, when he comes suddenly he might find you sleeping. 

><sup> 37 </sup> And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert!”

## The Devotion

>Romans 1:18–22 (CSB)  
><sup> 18 </sup> For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth, 

><sup> 19 </sup> since what can be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them. 

><sup> 20 </sup> For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being understood through what he has made. As a result, people are without excuse. 

><sup> 21 </sup> For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 

><sup> 22 </sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools

Listen, for us to obey, love, fear, understand, believe, trust in God, God will need to raise us up from out of our sins and death into light and life.

There is no two ways about it.

And then Paul in Romans will expose our natural state:

> 18 For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth

My birth and by choice, we suppress the truth.

Despite this in-born ignorance on our part, Christ pleads with humanity: don't miss it.

Be on alert.

Don't ignore the signs.

>Learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognize that he is near—at the door.

From the moment Christ ascended to the Father until the day of his return, that is the end times. There is no gap of not the end times. You and I are not waiting for more signs to tell us when the Great Tribulation is coming or whatever. We are in it. For the last 2000, the Christians saw it. We see it. Christ says, "Be on alert."

And those who do not fear God, Paul says "they are without excuse." If they are without excuse, how much more the sons of light who know God?

Christ is coming again. Be on alert.

What does that mean? Go and do extra things to show that you are really really saved? No. Go and do churchy things to show that Christ needs to pick you when he comes back? No. Christ knows his sheep and his sheep know his shepherd.

Look, just like in Exodus, when the angel of death passed over those who were covered by the blood of the lamb, Christ knows those who are covered by his blood because his name is Jesus. He has already saved His people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21)

The Great Shepherd, who has always been with us, is coming again. Sheep take comfort that their shepherd is near and cares for us. Christian, Christ has done it all. Be on alert that we are in the end times but Christ has you. God the Father is a perfect father--he has never lost any of his kids and he is not going to start with you.

Be in Christ.
