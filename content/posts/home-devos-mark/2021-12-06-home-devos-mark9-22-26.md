## The Text

>Mark 8:22–26 (CSB)  
><sup>22</sup> They came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him. 

><sup><sup> 23 </sup></sup> He took the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village. Spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” 

><sup> 24 </sup> He looked up and said, “I see people—they look like trees walking.” 

><sup> 25 </sup> Again Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes. The man looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly. 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then he sent him home, saying, “Don’t even go into the village.”
