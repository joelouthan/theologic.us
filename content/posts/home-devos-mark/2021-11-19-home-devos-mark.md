## The Text

>Mark 7:7–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 7 </sup> They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines human commands. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Abandoning the command of God, you hold on to human tradition.” 

><sup> 9 </sup> He also said to them, “You have a fine way of invalidating God’s command in order to set up your tradition! 

><sup> 10 </sup> For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death. 

><sup> 11 </sup> But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother: Whatever benefit you might have received from me is corban’ ” (that is, an offering devoted to God), 

><sup> 12 </sup> “you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 

><sup> 13 </sup> You nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other similar things.”
