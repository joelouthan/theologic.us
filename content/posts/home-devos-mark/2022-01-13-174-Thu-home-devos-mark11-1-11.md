## The Text

>Mark 11:1-11 (CSB) 
><sup> 1 </sup> When they approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples 

><sup> 2 </sup> and told them, “Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. 

><sup> 3 </sup> If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away.’ ” 

><sup> 4 </sup> So they went and found a colt outside in the street, tied by a door. They untied it, 

><sup> 5 </sup> and some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 

><sup> 6 </sup> They answered them just as Jesus had said; so they let them go. 

><sup> 7 </sup> They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and he sat on it. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Many people spread their clothes on the road, and others spread leafy branches cut from the fields. 

><sup> 9 </sup> Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted: Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! 

><sup> 10 </sup> Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven! 

><sup> 11 </sup> He went into Jerusalem and into the temple. After looking around at everything, since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
