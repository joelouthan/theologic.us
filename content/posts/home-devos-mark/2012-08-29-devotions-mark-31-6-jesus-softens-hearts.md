## The Devotion

### Christ comes to us and he knows our need

>Mark 3:1-6 (CSB) Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a shriveled hand.

### Sin waits to destroy us and does not give what we need

><sup> 2 </sup>In order to accuse him, they were watching him closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath.

>Genesis 4:5-7 (CSB) Cain was furious, and he looked despondent. 6 Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you furious? And why do you look despondent? 7 If you do what is right, won’t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”

### Christ brings us into his mercy and grace

><sup> 3 </sup>He told the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand before us.”

### Sin only hardens the heart to no longer fear God and to sin all the more

><sup> 4 </sup>Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.

### Unrepentant sin only brings out the wrath of God

><sup> 5 </sup>After looking around at them with anger, he was grieved at the hardness of their hearts

>John 3:36 (CSB) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.

### Faith, which is a gift from God, brings the love and salvation of God

>He told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

>Hebrews 11:5-6 (CSB) By faith Enoch was taken away, and so he did not experience death. He was not to be found because God took him away. For before he was taken away, he was approved as one who pleased God. 6 Now without faith it is impossible to please God, since the one who draws near to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

>Ephesians 2:8-9 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—9 not from works, so that no one can boast.

### Sin steals, kills, and destroys us--Christ is the fullness of life

><sup> 6 </sup>Immediately the Pharisees went out and started plotting with the Herodians against him, how they might kill him.
