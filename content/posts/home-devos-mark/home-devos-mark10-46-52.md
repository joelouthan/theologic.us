## The Text

>Mark 10:46-52 (CSB) 
><sup> 46 </sup> They came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. 

><sup> 47 </sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 

><sup> 48 </sup> Many warned him to keep quiet, but he was crying out all the more, “Have mercy on me, Son of David!” 

><sup> 49 </sup> Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage! Get up; he’s calling for you.” 

><sup> 50 </sup> He threw off his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus. 

><sup> 51 </sup> Then Jesus answered him, “What do you want me to do for you?” “Rabboni,” the blind man said to him, “I want to see.” 

><sup> 52 </sup> Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has saved you.” Immediately he could see and began to follow Jesus on the road. 

## The Devotion

### To know God is the know the heart of God for the poor

>Ezekiel 16:49 (CSB)
Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters had pride, plenty of food, and comfortable security, but didn’t support the poor and needy.

>Psalms 12:1-5 (CSB)
Help, LORD, for no faithful one remains;
the loyal have disappeared from the human race.
2 They lie to one another;
they speak with flattering lips and deceptive hearts.
3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips
and the tongue that speaks boastfully.
4 They say, “Through our tongues we have power;
our lips are our own — who can be our master? ”
5 “Because of the devastation of the needy
and the groaning of the poor,
I will now rise up,” says the LORD.
“I will provide safety for the one who longs for it.”

>1 Samuel 2:6-8 (CSB)
The LORD brings death and gives life;
he sends some down to Sheol, and he raises others up.
7 The LORD brings poverty and gives wealth;
he humbles and he exalts.
8 He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the needy from the trash heap.
He seats them with noblemen
and gives them a throne of honor.
For the foundations of the earth are the LORD’s;
he has set the world on them.

>Isaiah 25:4 (CSB)
For you have been a stronghold for the poor person,
a stronghold for the needy in his distress,
a refuge from storms and a shade from heat.
When the breath of the violent
is like a storm against a wall,

### To know God is to know that he sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to bring gospel to all of us--we are the poor ones

>Isaiah 61:1-3 (CSB)
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me,
because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor.
He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives
and freedom to the prisoners;
2 to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,
and the day of our God’s vengeance;
to comfort all who mourn,
3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion;
to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
festive oil instead of mourning,
and splendid clothes instead of despair.
And they will be called righteous trees,
planted by the LORD
to glorify him.

The gospel command is for all. The ones who respond yes are the ones who are poor in spirit because we know we have no where else to go--Christ alone is the Holy One of God who has eternal life.

## The Discussion

```text
1. What does it mean for each of us to be poor in spirit?
```

```text
2. What do you say to other Christians who say we are not poor but rich because of God or God wants us to be rich with material wealth?
```

```text
3. Can you make yourself poor in spirit or are you born that way?
```

```text
4. What does Christ give to those who are poor?
```

## The Prayer from the Psalms

>Psalm 8 (CSB)  
>   For the choir director: on the Gittith. A psalm of David. 

><sup> 1 </sup> LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth! You have covered the heavens with your majesty. 

><sup> 2 </sup> From the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have established a stronghold on account of your adversaries in order to silence the enemy and the avenger. 

><sup> 3 </sup> When I observe your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you set in place, 

><sup> 4 </sup> what is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him? 

><sup> 5 </sup> You made him little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor. 

><sup> 6 </sup> You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet: 

><sup> 7 </sup> all the sheep and oxen, as well as the animals in the wild, 

><sup> 8 </sup> the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea that pass through the currents of the seas. 

><sup> 9 </sup> LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!<sup>$0</sup>

  My Lord, Our Lord,
</div>

```text
Your name is known throughout all the earth.  
Your fame knows no bounds.  
Your glory will not be given to another.  
Your love is simply unmatched.  

And who you are and what you do is not determined and defined by the world around me. You are defined by your thoughts, your mind, your heart, and upon your revelation alone. I ask not for you to reveal more than what you have already reveal for my mind and soul and heart can barely comprehend your fullness now.

I can barely hold on to the grace that you have given me. But even in that holding on is grace upon grace. For that, I thank you.

You are God of the heavens, space, galaxies, and solar systems. You rule above it all. You are King and Lord over all kings and lords.

But you know me. Not just of me, but you know me. You know me and you love me.

You loved me enough to leave your throne, to leave your heavenly home, away from the Father, Spirit, and the heavenly hosts to come and get me. You rescued me from the uttermost depths of the oceans. You have retrieved me from the lips of the mouth of hell. You have saved me from death. You have loved me to bring me to you.

God, I love you. For all of my life and all of eternity, I will forever proclaim your glorious name. I love you. Thank you.

In your name, I pray.
Amen.
