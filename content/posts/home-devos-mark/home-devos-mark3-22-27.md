## The Text

>Mark 3:20–27 (CSB)  
><sup> 20 </sup> Jesus entered a house, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat. 

><sup> 21 </sup> When his family heard this, they set out to restrain him, because they said, “He’s out of his mind.” 

><sup> 22 </sup> The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons.” 

><sup> 23 </sup> So he summoned them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? 

><sup> 24 </sup> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 

><sup> 25 </sup> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 

><sup> 26 </sup> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished. 

><sup> 27 </sup> But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.


## The Devotion

>John 14:27 (CSB) “Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Don’t let your heart be troubled or fearful.

Christ came so that we can have peace--peace that is beyond all comprehension and beyond our understanding.

So many of us get confused when we hear this promise and rightfully so. We think that he has come to abolish all terrible circumstances and every single conflict. That is not what he came to do. For Christ said:

>Matthew 10:34 (CSB) Don’t assume that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

Is this an apparent contradiction?

No.

For his people and his people alone, he has come to bring peace within us. No matter what goes on in this post-Genesis 3 world and no matter what afflictions and persecution we might face, we will be okay because we will have God.

For those not his people, there is no assurance.

But because Christ is real and he was here and he is here and he dwells in us and we believe and trust in him, that will absolutely stir up a lot more conflict.

I am not just talk your co-workers or even perhaps your neighbor who votes differently than you. That is small potatoes. What about conflict with your parents or your siblings or even your kids because you follow God and they don't?

### To some, even some of your closest loved ones, you might appear out of your mind

><sup> 20 </sup> Jesus entered a house, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat. 

><sup> 21 </sup> When his family heard this, they set out to restrain him, because they said, “He’s out of his mind.” 

### To those who hate you anyways, they are going to try to vilify you

><sup> 22 </sup> The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons.” 

### When you are in Christ, all is well

><sup> 23 </sup> So he summoned them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? 

><sup> 24 </sup> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 

><sup> 25 </sup> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 

><sup> 26 </sup> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished. 

### Satan might be strong but he is not Almighty--Christ is the Almighty God

><sup> 27 </sup> But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.

Christ describing Satan as the strong man. That wasn't just a parable but a prophecy into the spiritual realm.

>Colossians 2:13-15 (CSB) And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Where does your confidence come from? From what you can remember or think or say or do or from who God is and what he has done for us?

2. As Christians, do we need to fight everybody who opposes us? What did Christ do with his opposition?

3. How did Christ "tie up and plunder the strong man's house"?
