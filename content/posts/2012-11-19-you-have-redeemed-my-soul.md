I was a hungry child
  
A dried up river
  
I was a burned out forest
  
And no one could do anything for me
  
But You put food in my body
  
And water in my dried bed
  
And to my blackened branches
  
You brought the springtime
  
green of new life
  
And nothing is impossible for You

_You have redeemed my soul
  
From the pit of emptiness
  
You have redeemed my soul
  
From death_
