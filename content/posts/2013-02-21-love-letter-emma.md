You are far more than what people see. Or as the saying goes, you are more than the sum of your parts. When people see you, they may see only your incredible beauty. And as wonderful as your beauty may be, your mind, heart and soul runs so much deeper.

This much I know of you: You are a scholar of the highest rank. Honestly, you are every bit the academic that I wish was. To try to describe just how smart you really are fails in that attempt. To that end, whatever knowledge, intellect, and wisdom that God has given me; they are yours for the taking. I want to do whatever it takes to flame that gift of God inside of your heart—a gift of knowledge and intelligence. Whatever I can do so that you can love God with all your heart, soul, strength and _mind,_ I will do so. Just because of your incredible mind, I am so honored and privileged to have known you.

Much more than that, from the moment I met you, the one thing you have given me were your warm affections and your desire to make me feel like I belong to you. Anything that we had in common, you were so quick to bring it to my attention.

“Guess what, Joe? You and I are the only ones with brown eyes!”

“You love books just as much as me.”

You always wanted to make me feel welcomed into your home. You wanted to make sure that I always felt _wanted._ You always made sure that I was loved.

You were the first to ask me for hugs.

You were the first to ask me for kisses.

You were the quickest to show just how much you love me.

You never knew this man from before. You didn’t know his incredible wealth of sin from a lifetime ago. You never knew the darkest and deepest pain that has injured his soul.

All you saw was me. You saw me and you accepted me. You accepted me and you wanted to know me. You wanted to know me and you loved me. I could thank you a million times over and I still would never thank you enough for your sweet love.

I never have known a prettier little girl. I have never met a smarter person. Yet, your charms and smarts are nothing compared to the bold and audacious love that you give to God and that you have given me.

I love you, Emma. I praise and thank God that he made you. I love you. Now and forever, I do.

&nbsp;

From your brown-eyed, book lovin’stepdad,

Joooooeeeeeee
