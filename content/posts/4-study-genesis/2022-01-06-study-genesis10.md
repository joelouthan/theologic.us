## The Text

>Genesis 10 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> These are the family records of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They also had sons after the flood. 

><sup> 2 </sup> Japheth’s sons: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Gomer’s sons: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 

><sup> 4 </sup> And Javan’s sons: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

><sup> 5 </sup> From these descendants, the peoples of the coasts and islands spread out into their lands according to their clans in their nations, each with its own language. 

><sup> 6 </sup> Ham’s sons: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 

><sup> 7 </sup> Cush’s sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah’s sons: Sheba and Dedan. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Cush fathered Nimrod, who began to be powerful in the land. 

><sup> 9 </sup> He was a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD. That is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD.” 

><sup> 10 </sup> His kingdom started with Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

><sup> 11 </sup> From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, 

><sup> 12 </sup> and Resen, between Nineveh and the great city Calah. 

><sup> 13 </sup> Mizraim fathered the people of Lud, Anam, Lehab, Naphtuh, 

><sup> 14 </sup> Pathrus, Casluh (the Philistines came from them), and Caphtor. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, 

><sup> 16 </sup> as well as the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 

><sup> 17 </sup> the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 

><sup> 18 </sup> the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the Canaanite clans scattered. 

><sup> 19 </sup> The Canaanite border went from Sidon going toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and going toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim as far as Lasha. 

><sup> 20 </sup> These are Ham’s sons by their clans, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations. 

><sup> 21 </sup> And Shem, Japheth’s older brother, also had sons. Shem was the father of all the sons of Eber. 

><sup> 22 </sup> Shem’s sons were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 

><sup> 23 </sup> Aram’s sons: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 

><sup> 24 </sup> Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 

><sup> 25 </sup> Eber had two sons. One was named Peleg, for during his days the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan. 

><sup> 26 </sup> And Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 

><sup> 27 </sup> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 

><sup> 28 </sup> Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 

><sup> 29 </sup> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan’s sons. 

><sup> 30 </sup> Their settlements extended from Mesha to Sephar, the eastern hill country. 

><sup> 31 </sup> These are Shem’s sons by their clans, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations. 

><sup> 32 </sup> These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their family records, in their nations. The nations on earth spread out from these after the flood.
