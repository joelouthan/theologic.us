## The Introduction

## The Text

>Genesis 9:18â€“29 (CSB)  
><sup> 18 </sup> Noahâ€™s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. 

><sup> 19 </sup> These three were Noahâ€™s sons, and from them the whole earth was populated. 

><sup> 20 </sup> Noah, as a man of the soil, began by planting a vineyard. 

><sup> 21 </sup> He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. 

><sup> 22 </sup> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside. 

><sup> 23 </sup> Then Shem and Japheth took a cloak and placed it over both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their fatherâ€™s nakedness. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father naked. 

><sup> 24 </sup> When Noah awoke from his drinking and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 

><sup> 25 </sup> he said: Canaan is cursed. He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers. 

><sup> 26 </sup> He also said: Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; Let Canaan be Shemâ€™s slave. 

><sup> 27 </sup> Let God extend Japheth; let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem; let Canaan be Shemâ€™s slave. 

><sup> 28 </sup> Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 

><sup> 29 </sup> So Noahâ€™s life lasted 950 years; then he died.
