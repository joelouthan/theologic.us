## The Introduction

## The Text

>Genesis 7:1–10 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> Then the LORD said to Noah, “Enter the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation. 

><sup> 2 </sup> You are to take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, of all the clean animals, and two of the animals that are not clean, a male and its female, 

><sup> 3 </sup> and seven pairs, male and female, of the birds of the sky—in order to keep offspring alive throughout the earth. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Seven days from now I will make it rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing I have made I will wipe off the face of the earth.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> And Noah did everything that the LORD commanded him. 

><sup> 6 </sup> Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came and water covered the earth. 

><sup> 7 </sup> So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives entered the ark because of the floodwaters. 

><sup> 8 </sup> From the animals that are clean, and from the animals that are not clean, and from the birds and every creature that crawls on the ground, 

><sup> 9 </sup> two of each, male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, just as God had commanded him. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Seven days later the floodwaters came on the earth.
