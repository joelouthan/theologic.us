## The Introduction

## The Text

>Genesis 1:20-25 (CSB) Then God said, “Let the water swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” So God created the large sea-creatures and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water, according to their kinds. He also created every winged creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them: “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.” Evening came and then morning: the fifth day.
>
>Then God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

## The Support

>Hebrews 11:3 (CSB) By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.

**Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?**

## God

### God Made Everything Out of Nothing

To believe in God, to trust in Christ, and to take Him at His word, by that very same word, you must believe that He created everything out of nothing. This is essentially to the faith of the Christian. There are no exceptions.

That is why the Apostles' Creed declares from the start:

>>I believe in God, the Father almighty,
>>maker of heaven and earth;

And the Nicene Creed from the beginning also declares:

>>We believe in one God,
>>the Father, the Almighty,
>>maker of heaven and earth,
>>of all that is, seen and unseen.

What I did not say that we are somehow forbidden to discover, research, and examine all of God's creation--we should because all knowledge, science, and truth comes from God. (1 Corinthians 3:18-23) We can debate how we got here, the number of years that mankind has existed, the number of years that creation itself has existed--there is contention and debate there and I know that those debates will always continue on this side of heaven.

However, I will say this again: to be a Christian is to believe that Christ is your Savior and Lord and from within that belief, we believe that God is Creator of everything. The whole of Scripture declares this rightly. From that belief, here are two doctrinal implications. In other words, according to Scripture, since you must believe that God created everything, here are two results of that belief.

### God is Sovereign Lord Over All Creation

This is not from a mere observation viewpoint as God sees everything as he told Job:

>Job 39:1-4 (CSB) Do you know when mountain goats give birth?  
>Have you watched the deer in labor?  
>Can you count the months they are pregnant  
>so you can know the time they give birth?  
>They crouch down to give birth to their young;  
>they deliver their newborn.  
>Their offspring are healthy and grow up in the open field.  
>They leave and do not return.

However, remember of the story of Noah. Noah was declared righteous and then he obeyed God in building the ark. Noah did not have to command creation--that responsibility fell directly on God who is Lord:

>Genesis 7:8-9 (CSB) From the animals that are clean, and from the animals that are not clean, and from the birds and every creature that crawls on the ground, two of each, male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, just as God had commanded him.

### God is Provider for All of Creation

If you continue to read on in Job 39 till chapter 41, God will continue to emphasize that he is the basic need provider for all of His creation.

The author of Psalms 104 worships in this way:

>Psalms 104:10-18 (CSB)  
>He causes the springs to gush into the valleys;  
>they flow between the mountains.  
>They supply water for every wild beast;  
>the wild donkeys quench their thirst.  
>The birds of the sky live beside the springs;  
>they make their voices heard among the foliage.  
>He waters the mountains from his palace;  
>the earth is satisfied by the fruit of your labor.  
>He causes grass to grow for the livestock  
>and provides crops for man to cultivate,  
>producing food from the earth,  
>wine that makes human hearts glad—  
>making his face shine with oil—  
>and bread that sustains human hearts.  
>The trees of the LORD flourish,  
>the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.  
>There the birds make their nests;  
>storks make their homes in the pine trees.  
>The high mountains are for the wild goats;  
>the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.

During the ministry of Jesus, he was confronted with the practical needs of the people--the need for shelter, protection, clothes, food, and water. That is why when we see a need among our neighbors, because we are the Bride of Christ, we get to respond in the way God responds to our need.

Look at how Jesus speaks of this provision for our most basic needs:

>Matthew 6:26-30 (CSB) Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they? Can any of you add one moment to his life span by worrying? And why do you worry about clothes? Observe how the wildflowers of the field grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these. If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won’t he do much more for you—you of little faith?

## The Gospel

This is the gospel commandment of God: believe and trust in Him alone.

If we are to believe and trust in him, we must understand a couple of things.

### God is need of nothing--He owns all of creation

>Psalms 50:1-13 (CSB)  
>The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks;  
>he summons the earth  
>from the rising of the sun to its setting.  
>From Zion, the perfection of beauty,  
>God appears in radiance.  
>Our God is coming; he will not be silent!  
>Devouring fire precedes him,  
>and a storm rages around him.  
>On high, he summons heaven and earth  
>in order to judge his people:  
>“Gather my faithful ones to me,  
>those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”  
>The heavens proclaim his righteousness,  
>for God is the Judge.
>
>Selah  
>
>“Listen, my people, and I will speak;  
>I will testify against you, Israel.  
>I am God, your God.  
>I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices  
>or for your burnt offerings,  
>which are continually before me.  
>I will not take a bull from your household  
>or male goats from your pens,  
>for every animal of the forest is mine,  
>the cattle on a thousand hills.  
>I know every bird of the mountains,  
>and the creatures of the field are mine.  
>If I were hungry, I would not tell you,  
>for the world and everything in it is mine.  
>Do I eat the flesh of bulls  
>or drink the blood of goats?

### Since he owns everything--everything we have comes from God

>Psalms 16:5-6 (CSB)  
>LORD, you are my portion  
>and my cup of blessing;  
>you hold my future.  
>The boundary lines have fallen for me  
>in pleasant places;  
>indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.

Here is the call: change your mind about what you have and where it comes from.

Our paychecks, our livelihood, the knowledge in our brains, the strength in our hands, the college we attended, the cars we drive, the clothes on our back, 5G and high speed internet--all of it--comes from God.

## Our Responsibility

### Believe in God as Provision

But to say we believe in God, trust in Christ and take him at his word, means that we know that He will provide for all of our needs.

>Matthew 6:31-32 (CSB) So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

God spoke all of creation out of nothing into existence. Do you think he struggles with providing for our needs? Absolutely not.

If we know that and trust God in that, how can we respond?

### Thank the Lord Because He Provides for Us Everything

>Psalms 50:14-15 (CSB) Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice to God,  
>and pay your vows to the Most High.  
>Call on me in a day of trouble;  
>I will rescue you, and you will honor me.”

### Seek After What Really Matters

>Matthew 6:33 (CSB) But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. 

Just like God provides the necessary sacrifice to save Isaac, God sends his Son as the necessary sacrifice to save our lives.

><sup>34</sup> Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

For the Christian, our days are in his hands. Our lives are forever with him. No one can snatch us out of his hands. Not even death can separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Provision
</div>
&nbsp;

My days are counted out by you.

You have always provided for me perfectly.

And I know because I was in need of a Savior and a Sacrifice for my sins--and in your love and grace and mercy, you gave me your Son.

Blessed be your holy name.

Amen.
