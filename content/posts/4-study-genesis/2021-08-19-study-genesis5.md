`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

The gospel was always the plan. It is still always the plan.

Everything that God is, it would be well within his rights to do as he please: wipe the earth and start over (Genesis 6) or wipe a nation and start over (Exodus 33).

He can do whatever he wants and he does as he pleased.

But through it all, no matter how sinful and treasonous our responses and actions might be, God is still merciful. It does not matter if we get it right or not, God is gracious and kind and he is inviting us not get it right or figure it out, but "come and see" the glory of God--Jesus Christ. (John 1:46)

## The Gospel

From:

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring.  
>He will strike your head,  
>and you will strike his heel.

to:

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

God was going to be sin for man so that we might be the righteousness of God. (2 Corinthians 5:21)

When I got saved back in 2007, a older gent gave me this USB thumb-drive with tons of Christian resources. On that little drive was Chuck Missler's "Learn the Bible in 24 Hours."

Just a little forewarn: he can jump the rails a little. But what I learned in that 24 hour session changed my life. My sweetest and fondest memories was binge watching these video series of nothing but Powerpoint presentations. I was in my little north Dallas apartment, on the same computer and monitor where just a few months earlier I had consumed porn without end, was now used by God to fill my heart and mind with the knowledge of him. I remember falling asleep at my desk finishing Isaiah on New Year's Eve and then waking up the next morning to Jeremiah and just kept right along.

It was a great gracious gift of God that lead me in the direction of where I am today. And I will never forget what Mr. Missler taught in the Genesis episode:

So, do a quick little online search and see what each of these names in Genesis 5, from Adam to Noah, what they mean and put it all together. Just a heads up, when I did this, I had to dig a little beyond Wikipedia. But check this out:

| Name       | Meaning                |
|------------|------------------------|
| Adam       | man                    |
| Seth       | appointed              |
| Enosh      | mortal                 |
| Kenan      | sorrow                 |
| Mahalalel  | the shining one of God |
| Jared      | descend                |
| Enoch      | teaching               |
| Methuselah | purpose death          |
| Lamech     | make low               |
| Noah       | rest                   |

Put that into a sentence:

"Man appointed mortal sorrow; the Shining One of God descends and teaches--his purposeful death will give those who are lowly, rest."

Sounds a tad familiar? Who is the only one who can give us rest for our weary souls--when we have spent all of our lives chasing down things not-God to fill our empty hearts, only to be broken hearted again and again.

Who is the only one?

>Matthew 11:28-30 (CSB) 28 “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

## Our Responsibility

### We are to put our faith in the one gives us rest by living and dying for us

>Romans 5:6-11 (CSB) For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 8 But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath. 10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 11 And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

Christ is the only one who has proven his love for us.

Christ is the only one who can justified us with his death.

Christ is the only one who can saved us from his wrath.

Christ is the only one who can reconcile us to God with his death.

Christ is the only one who can saved us by his life.

>Genesis 5:21-24 (CSB) Enoch was 65 years old when he fathered Methuselah. 22 And after he fathered Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 23 So Enoch’s life lasted 365 years. 24 Enoch walked with God; then he was not there because God took him.

People might think it is amazing that God took up Enoch in an instant. Even the author of Hebrews would agreed.

>Hebrews 11:5-6 (CSB) By faith Enoch was taken away, and so he did not experience death. He was not to be found because God took him away. For before he was taken away, he was approved as one who pleased God. 6 Now without faith it is impossible to please God, since the one who draws near to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

But what was more amazing that the Bible says this about Enoch, "that he walked with God".

>Jude 1:14-16 (CSB) It was about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied: “Look! The Lord comes with tens of thousands of his holy ones 15 to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly concerning all the ungodly acts that they have done in an ungodly way, and concerning all the harsh things ungodly sinners have said against him.” 16 These people are discontented grumblers, living according to their desires; their mouths utter arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage.

Enoch preached the gospel of God to "people are discontented grumblers, living according to their desires; their mouths utter arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage."

Don't let the good news of God fall on your deaf ears. Listen and believe and repent and obey the Lord!

### Boast in God

>Romans 5:11 And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

Go and praise God that you are saved today. Give thanks for all that he has done.
