## The Introduction

## The Text

>Genesis 8:15‚Äì22 (CSB)  
><sup> 15 </sup> Then God spoke to Noah, 

><sup> 16 </sup> ‚ÄúCome out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons‚Äô wives with you. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Bring out all the living creatures that are with you‚Äîbirds, livestock, those that crawl on the earth‚Äîand they will spread over the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.‚Äù 

><sup> 18 </sup> So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons‚Äô wives, came out. 

><sup> 19 </sup> All the animals, all the creatures that crawl, and all the flying creatures‚Äîeverything that moves on the earth‚Äîcame out of the ark by their families. 

><sup> 20 </sup> Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. He took some of every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 

><sup> 21 </sup> When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, he said to himself, ‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of human beings, even though the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth onward. And I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done. 

><sup> 22 </sup> As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.‚Äù
