## The Text

>Genesis 3:1-13 (CSB) Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You can’t eat from any tree in the garden’?”
>
>2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. 3 But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’”
>
>4 “No! You will certainly not die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 6 The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
>
>8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 9 So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
>
>10 And he said, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”
>
>11 Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
>
>12 The man replied, “The woman you gave to be with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.”
>
>13 So the LORD God asked the woman, “What have you done?”
>
>And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

## The Support

>Romans 5:12 (CSB) Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned.

## God

In this particular study, I was tempted in breaking my usual template and wanted to step away from examining God first. But the more I read the passage,  the more we can see what the passage does say about God *in light of the lies and schemes of Satan.*

In other words, the more you know God and his word, the more that your mind and heart can instantly reject the lies of Satan and the philosophies of this world.

### God is creator of all things

>3:1a Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the LORD God had made.

God is the creator of all things--all animals, plants, humans, angels, Satan, demons, and hell. A question might arise, "Did God create someone or something that undoes His good creation?" God did create all but not for the expressed purpose of countering and end up sinning against God.

We have examined Genesis 1 and 2. We know the intentions of God that this was always to suppose to be perfect with the jewel of his creation, Mankind, being in perfect, right-standing, and holy relationship with his maker. Where it all goes wrong does not fall at feet of the Creator of all things but rather those who willfully sinned against the Creator.

Is God powerless to stop evil? No, absolutely not. The explanation on why he did not stop the snake nor Eve nor Adam from sinning against him cannot be easily explained away. This is where I confess where my finite mind cannot comprehend the Infinite God who is all knowing, all powerful, and present everywhere. I am a mere mortal that will not dare judge God and make this all of his fault. I know that my actions against him was sin and it has devastated and destroyed my life and those around me. But only God is good and He was the only one who can come save me out of death and into life.

### God is generous

>3:1b He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You can’t eat from any tree in the garden’?”

Satan here will immediately attack the children of God and lie about God's perfect provision and generosity.

The counter punch to this Satanic lie comes from Christ himself:

>Matthew 6:25-34 (CSB) “Therefore I tell you: Don’t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? 26 Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they? 27 Can any of you add one moment to his life span by worrying? 28 And why do you worry about clothes? Observe how the wildflowers of the field grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these. 30 If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won’t he do much more for you—you of little faith? 31 So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. 34 Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Christ forever has his brothers and sisters. No one is going to snatch them out of the seal of the Spirit and the double grip of the Father and the Son.

If the children of God can never be separate, what is generosity but by the grace of God? And what is provision other than the Sovereign Lord himself.

### God is holy

>3:2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. 3 But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’”

Did you catch that? What is the difference between what God commanded and what Eve repeated?

>... or touch it,...

God is holy--God is completely set apart from all evil and sin. Or to put it rightly,sin and evil is completely separated from God. God is far above, far from, separated, and wholly rejects sin.

The saints of the Old Testament had a grasp on his holiness and they knew the gospel. But not in a million years could have guess that God would have come into our broken world as a newborn baby boy and be able to topple kingdoms left and right thousands of years after his death and ascension.

God is holy and therefore the commandments that come from God are holy.

But listen, even when we keep on dog-piling man-made rules on top of man-made rules onto his holy law because man is a legalistic machine, God is still holy and his law is good. Not content just for the word of God to stand alone, we love to put rules on top of God's good gifts. Gifts like love, ministry, raising children, marriage, and relationship. We don't need more rules. We need God and we need his word because it is true and perfect.

And you think three little words in addition to God's commandment wouldn't do any harm. Adam and Eve thought so well. And they could have never imagine where that little bit of separation would have taken them and all of mankind.

## The Gospel

### God alone gives and preserves life

>4 “No! You will certainly not die,” the serpent said to the woman.

In this, the serpent told the half-true, which is a full lie. But the Devil will never give us the full truth. Do you think when sin entered into this word that Adam and Eve thought they would see death all around them and then live long enough to see their son, Abel, murdered by his own brother? Only then, to die and perish?

They didn't die instantly. But they did die. The spirit of God that was in them left their now mortal, sin-filled bodies to rot and perish.

The counter to this was the life and existence of Jesus Christ.

>Romans 8:10-11 (CSB) Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. 11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.

Jesus was born just like we were. Grew in stature and wisdom. And when the time came to step into his ministry, the Spirit of God descended upon him and remained in Christ until Christ gave up his spirit on the cross so that the children of God would live forever!

### God is God alone

>3:5 “In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

Are there any other gods?

>Psalms 97:9 (CSB) For you, LORD,  
>are the Most High over the whole earth;  
>you are exalted above all the gods.

>Isaiah 44:8 (CSB) Do not be startled or afraid.  
>Have I not told you and declared it long ago?  
>You are my witnesses!  
>Is there any God but me?  
>There is no other Rock; I do not know any.

Asaph writes it in this way about those who think of themselves like a god

>Psalms 82 (CSB) God stands in the divine assembly;  
>he pronounces judgment among the gods:  
>2 “How long will you judge unjustly  
>and show partiality to the wicked?Selah  
>3 Provide justice for the needy and the fatherless;  
>uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.  
>4 Rescue the poor and needy;  
>save them from the power of the wicked.”  
>5 They do not know or understand;  
>they wander in darkness.  
>All the foundations of the earth are shaken.  
>6 I said, “You are gods;  
>you are all sons of the Most High.  
>7 However, you will die like humans  
>and fall like any other ruler.”  
>8 Rise up, God, judge the earth,  
>for all the nations belong to you.

Adam and Eve were tempted by being like God. They were not satisfied with being right-standing and in perfect community with God. They thought there was something more--something more life giving. There is nothing more than God. Sin, hell, Satan, and demons will preach to your heart and soul and mind all the long day: "There is something greater than this. Follow your heart. You are sad. Why not be happy?"

You followed your heart. And you end up in the deepest, darkest trenches, left for dead. And if God has mercy on your soul, you will want something more than death.

## Our Responsibility

### Realize and know: we have nothing more than God

>6 The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

>John 6:65-69 (CSB) He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father.”
>
>66 From that moment many of his disciples turned back and no longer accompanied him. 67 So Jesus said to the Twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”
>
>68 Simon Peter answered, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”

### Realize and know: sin brings shame into our souls

>3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

### Realize and know: no matter how far you are, God is chasing after you

>3:8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.

### Realize and know: God is calling out to you

>3:9 So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”

### Realize and know: God is merciful, kind, and gracious to you--even if you think you have committed the worst kinds of sin

>3:10 And he said, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”

### Realize and know: God is truth and will proclaim truth to you in grace and love

>3:11 Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”

### Realize and know: you don't need to blame anybody else for your sin

>3:12 The man replied, “The woman you gave to be with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.”

### Realize and know: God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to save you and to take on your sin

>3:13 So the LORD God asked the woman, “What have you done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

>Romans 1:21-23 (CSB) For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.

Or to put it in another way:

>Titus 3:3 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.

We were so foolish, dumb, blind, and dead that we didn't know we were being deceived and led astray right into death.

But this what God is offering: Himself.

This is his response to his lost and forsaken children:

>Titus 3:4-7 (CSB) But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 5 he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. 6 He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior 7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.

You are not going to think right and love right on your own. If you sit and think I don't need God to do those things, then I have no good news for you. But if you know you are desperate and need to be rescued from the world and this life, call to Jesus.

Call upon his name and he will give himself over to you.

He is going to ask for your life--all of your thoughts, your heart, your sin, your wrongdoings, everything. But in exchange he gives you eternal life, complete satisfaction, fullness of joy and pleasures evermore.

Amen.
