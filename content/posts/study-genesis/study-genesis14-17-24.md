## The Text

>Genesis 14:17–24 (CSB)  
><sup> 17 </sup> After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Shaveh Valley (that is, the King’s Valley). 

><sup> 18 </sup> Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was a priest to God Most High. 

><sup> 19 </sup> He blessed him and said: Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 

><sup> 20 </sup> and blessed be God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you. And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 

><sup> 21 </sup> Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the possessions for yourself.” 

><sup> 22 </sup> But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand in an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 

><sup> 23 </sup> that I will not take a thread or sandal strap or anything that belongs to you, so you can never say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 

><sup> 24 </sup> I will take nothing except what the servants have eaten. But as for the share of the men who came with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—they can take their share.”
