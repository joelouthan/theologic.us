## The Introduction

## The Text

>Genesis 1:6-13 (CSB) Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.” So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse. And it was so. God called the expanse “sky.” Evening came and then morning: the second day.
>
>Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of the water he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.” And it was so. The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. Evening came and then morning: the third day.

## The Support

### The faith of the believer in Christ is that God made everything and he did so out of nothing

>Hebrews 11:3 (CSB) By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was

**Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?**

## God

>Acts 17:24-28 (ESV) The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, for  
>
>“‘In him we live and move and have our being’;  
>as even some of your own poets have said,  
>“‘For we are indeed his offspring.’

### God alone is Creator, Sovereign, Omnipresent, Provider of Everything including life

><sup>24-25</sup> The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.

## The Gospel

### God determines the times and places of where we live

><sup>26</sup>From one man he has made every nationality to live over the whole earth and has determined their appointed times and the boundaries of where they live.

### God does this not because of our comfort, liking, investments, or the safety so that we could carry out the commission from Christ Jesus

><sup>27</sup>He did this so that they might seek God, and perhaps they might reach out and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.

### The glory of God is not contained in what we do--no matter how hard we try to box in God

><sup>28</sup>For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’ Since, then, we are God’s offspring, we shouldn’t think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image fashioned by human art and imagination.

>Psalms 72:19 (CSB) Blessed be his glorious name forever;
>the whole earth is filled with his glory.
>Amen and amen.

>Habakkuk 2:14 (CSB) For the earth will be filled
>with the knowledge of the LORD’s glory,
>as the water covers the sea.

Idolatry is our feeble attempt to control God.

## Our Responsibility

### Why are we to carry out the Great Commission?

Why are we to "go, and raise disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything Christ commands us to do?" (Matthew 28:19-20)

Why are we to "go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation." (Mark 16:15)?

Why are we to be His "witnesses" in our city, our nation, and all over the world? (Acts 1:8)

### Here is the gospel command

>Acts 17:30-31 (CSB) Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed. He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”

Now, I have said it once, I will say it a hundred times: the commands of the Lord are easier said than done.

When you preach, share, proclaim the gospel--when you share your testimony and the power of God--you are going to get three responses

### You will be ridiculed and mocked

>Acts 17:32-34 (CSB) When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to ridicule him...

### You will get some with good intentions with a hundred questions or just some lookee-lous

>... but others said, “We’d like to hear from you again about this.”

### You will get some that will just follow Christ

>So Paul left their presence. However, some people joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

## No matter what the response that you get in the moment

### God will be with you always

### God will be with you until the end of the age

### God is redeeming the whole earth

Our forever home was never about the dirt underneath our feet, the roof over our heads, or even the family we do or don't have, it was always the presence of the Almighty God.

God is sending every single person who trusts and obeys His Son Jesus Christ to invite and bring in others who are far, far from him.

Go and tell them that there is a God who made you, who loves you, who is not far from you, who is inviting you change your mind about your life, to trust in Him, and come on home to him forever.

### In his presence, there is only life, there is only fullness of joy and there is only pleasures forevermore

>Psalms 16:11 (ESV)  
>You make known to me the path of life;  
>in your presence there is fullness of joy;  
>at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

### In his presence, is only complete satisfaction

>Psalms 17:15 (ESV)  
>As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;  
>when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.

There is nothing else ever--not your life, being married, sex, success, power, wealth, kids--nothing at all will give you complete satisfaction and pleasures forevermore.

Once God opens our eyes, renews our minds, and exchanges our hearts, we worship like the sons of Korah once sang:

>Psalms 84:10 (CSB) Better a day in your courts  
>than a thousand anywhere else.  
>I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God  
>than live in the tents of wicked people.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Our Forever Home
</div>
&nbsp;

Where else can we go?  

For you alone have the words to eternal life.  

And we now know that Jesus Christ is the Holy One of God forever.

Amen.
