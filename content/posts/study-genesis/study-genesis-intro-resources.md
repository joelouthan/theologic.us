## Introduction

Why Genesis? The pat answer is that it is beginning of everything that God has done. Everything we read from Exodus on, including and especially in the Gospels, can be traced right back to the first instance in Genesis.

The real answer is that this is a sincere challenge and I want to walk through it.

Here just the very small list of resources on Genesis that I have found most helpful.

## It Goes Without Say

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DXb+atXsL.jpg" align="left" width="200" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without errorâ€”they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!
