Here just the very small list of resources on Romans that I have found most helpful.

## It Goes Without Say

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DXb+atXsL.jpg" align="left" width="200" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without errorâ€”they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.
