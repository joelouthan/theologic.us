## The Introduction

## The Text

>2 Timothy 1:8â€“12 (CSB)  
><sup> 8 </sup> So donâ€™t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me his prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God. 

><sup> 9 </sup> He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began. 

><sup> 10 </sup> This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 

><sup> 11 </sup> For this gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher, 

><sup> 12 </sup> and that is why I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.
