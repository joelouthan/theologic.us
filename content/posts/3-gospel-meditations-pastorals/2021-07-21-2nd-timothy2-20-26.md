## The Introduction

We too were once led astray. We were also dead in our trespasses. We were once vessels made for the wrath of God.

But God alone took away that status and gave us a new life.

## The Text

>2 Timothy 2:20â€“26 (CSB)  
><sup> 20 </sup> Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also those of wood and clay; some for honorable use and some for dishonorable. 

><sup> 21 </sup> So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable, he will be a special instrument, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 

><sup> 22 </sup> Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. 

><sup> 23 </sup> But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, because you know that they breed quarrels. 

><sup> 24 </sup> The Lordâ€™s servant must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient, 

><sup> 25 </sup> instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth. 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then they may come to their senses and escape the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
