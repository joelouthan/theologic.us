<pre><blockquote>
  O Father, I thank thee that in fullness of grace
  thou hast given me to Jesus, to be his sheep,
  jewel, portion;
  
  O Jesus, I thank thee that in fullness of grace
  thou hast accepted, espoused, bound me;
  
  O Holy Spirit, I thank thee that in fullness of
  grace thou hast
  exhibited Jesus as my salvation,
  implanted faith within me,
  subdued my stubborn heart,
  made me one with him for ever.
</blockquote></pre>
