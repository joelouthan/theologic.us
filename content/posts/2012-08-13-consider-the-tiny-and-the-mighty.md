The day will come when the Kingdom of God will surpass in glory the mightiest kingdoms of the earth, for it is the consequence of God&#8217;s sovereign action. The mustard seed is the word of God proclaimed by Christ. This word possesses the power which one day will make all things new. When the glory of that manifestation breaks forth before men they will be as startled as the man who considers the tiny mustard seed and the mighty shrub.
