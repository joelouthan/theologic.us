## The Creed

```text
The third day He arose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
```

## The Word

>1 Corinthians 15:1-8 (CSB) Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received, on which you have taken your stand and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you — unless you believed in vain. For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me.

## The Belief

### The third day He arose again from the dead

>John 20:1–18 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark. She saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. 

><sup>2</sup> So she went running to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said to them, “They’ve taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they’ve put him!” 

><sup>3</sup> At that, Peter and the other disciple went out, heading for the tomb. 

><sup>4</sup> The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and got to the tomb first. 

><sup>5</sup> Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 

><sup>6</sup> Then, following him, Simon Peter also came. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. 

><sup>7</sup> The wrapping that had been on his head was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a separate place by itself. 

><sup>8</sup> The other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, then also went in, saw, and believed. 

><sup>9</sup> For they did not yet understand the Scripture that he must rise from the dead. 

><sup>10</sup> Then the disciples returned to the place where they were staying. 

><sup>11</sup> But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she stooped to look into the tomb. 

><sup>12</sup> She saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’s body had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. 

><sup>13</sup> They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?” “Because they’ve taken away my Lord,” she told them, “and I don’t know where they’ve put him.” 

><sup>14</sup> Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know it was Jesus. 

><sup>15</sup> “Woman,” Jesus said to her, “why are you crying? Who is it that you’re seeking?” Supposing he was the gardener, she replied, “Sir, if you’ve carried him away, tell me where you’ve put him, and I will take him away.” 

><sup>16</sup> Jesus said to her, “Mary.” Turning around, she said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!”—which means “Teacher.” 

><sup>17</sup> “Don’t cling to me,” Jesus told her, “since I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” 

><sup>18</sup> Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what he had said to her.

### He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty

>Acts 2:29-39 (CSB) “Brothers and sisters, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah: He was not abandoned in Hades, and his flesh did not experience decay.  
>
>“God has raised this Jesus; we are all witnesses of this. Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, he has poured out what you both see and hear. For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says:  
>The Lord declared to my Lord,  
>‘Sit at my right hand  
>until I make your enemies your footstool.’  
>
>“Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
>
>When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do? ”
>Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call.”

And:

>Hebrews 10:11-14 (CSB) Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins. But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. He is now waiting until his enemies are made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.

### whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead

>Revelation 20:11 - 21:8 (CSB) Then I saw a great white throne and one seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to their works by what was written in the books. Then the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; each one was judged according to their works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
>
>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. I also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
>
>Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away.
>
>Then the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.” Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But the cowards, faithless, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars — their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

## Our Response

What has Christ commissioned us to do?

>2 Timothy 4:1-5 (CSB) I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom: **Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching**. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
