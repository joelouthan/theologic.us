## The Creed

>>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
>>the Creator of heaven and earth,  
>>and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:  
>>Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,  
>>born of the Virgin Mary,  
>>suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
>>was crucified, died, and was buried.  
>>He descended into hell.  
>>  
>>The third day He arose again from the dead.  
>>He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,  
>>whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  
>>  
>>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,  
>>the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,  
>>the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.  
>>  
>>Amen.
