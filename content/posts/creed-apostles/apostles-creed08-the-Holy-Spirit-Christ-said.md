description: "In Evangelicalism, there are usually two perspectives of Christians. Either, there has been too little taught about the Holy Spirit and on the other, there has been too much said about the Holy Spirit. Both are usually over-corrections and more often than not, a great deal of harm to Evangelical theology as a whole. But may I submit that we should go to Someone who has been with the Spirit from before the beginning. Let us examine what Christ has said about the Holy Spirit."

## The Creed

```text
I believe in the Holy Spirit
```

## The Word

>Romans 8:9-11 (CSB) You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him. Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.

## The Belief

### Believe in the Holy Spirit: What Christ has said

>John 3:3–9 (CSB) Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” “How can anyone be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?” Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again. The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” “How can these things be?” asked Nicodemus.

#### On Christ: The Spirit births us into the Kingdom of God

When Christ said, "You must be born again," make no mistake: you must be born again but you, yourself, cannot born yourself again. Our salvation, seeing the kingdom of God, the understanding of his word--everything--is completely 100% supernatural. No exceptions.

"You must be born again" - treat this like a command and you will fall into despair because this is a command that you and I cannot obey. The unbeliever can fool themselves into thinking that they are obeying God because it seems, on the surface, that they can do the same thing we do: read our Bible, pray, give to the poor, don't kill, steal, destroy. But there is difference that is everything: believers are born of the Spirit of God while unbelievers are born of the flesh. One is in God, the other is in himself. One believes in Christ and lives, the other has the wrath of God abiding on him. One is in the Second Adam; the other is still in the First Adam. There is no muddling between the two.

---

>John 16:7 (CSB) Nevertheless, I am telling you the truth. It is for your benefit that I go away, because if I don’t go away the Counselor will not come to you. If I go, I will send him to you. 

#### On Christ: Christ sent to the Spirit to us

>Acts 1:4-8 (CSB) While he was with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father’s promise. “Which,” he said, “you have heard me speak about; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit in a few days.” So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time? ” He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”

---

>John 16:8 (CSB) When he comes, he will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment: 

#### On Christ: The Spirit will convict the world of three things

---

>John 16:9 (CSB) About sin, because they do not believe in me; 

#### On Christ: Only the Spirit can convict of sin

Preaching against sin versus conviction of sin

---

>John 16:10 (CSB) about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me; 

#### On Christ: Only the Spirit gives us the righteousness of Christ

>Romans 1:17 (CSB) For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

---

>John 16:11 (CSB) and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. 

#### On Christ: Only the Spirit has the power to judge the Satan and his demons

---

>John 16:12-13 (CSB) “I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak on his own, but he will speak whatever he hears. He will also declare to you what is to come. 

#### On Christ: Only the Spirit guides into all truth

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

>>our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.

---

>John 16:14 (CSB) He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. 

#### On Christ: The Spirit glorifies Christ

---

>John 16:15 (CSB) Everything the Father has is mine. This is why I told you that he takes from what is mine and will declare it to you.

#### On Christ: The Spirit gives us everything the Father has given to Christ

##### Adoption

>Romans 8:14-17 (CSB) For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father! ” The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs — heirs of God and coheirs with Christ — if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

##### Ministry

>John 3:34-35 (CSB) For the one whom God sent speaks God’s words, since he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hands.

##### Intercesssion

>Romans 8:26-27 (CSB) In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
