description: "So much has been said and written and preached about the Holy Spirit. Most of that was born out of a deficiency in some Evangelical's understanding (re: Baptist) and to counter that deficiency, there have been a overemphasis on the Spirit of God. In this overemphasis, what is lacking, is the the absolutely sense that the Spirit of God is fully God."

## The Creed

>>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
>>the Creator of heaven and earth,  
>>and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:  
>>Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,  
>>born of the Virgin Mary,  
>>suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
>>was crucified, died, and was buried.  
>>He descended into hell.  
>>  
>>The third day He arose again from the dead.  
>>He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,  
>>whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  
>>  
>>**I believe in the Holy Spirit**, the holy catholic church,  
>>the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,  
>>the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.  
>>  
>>Amen.

## The Word

>John 16:7-15 (CSB) Nevertheless, I am telling you the truth. It is for your benefit that I go away, because if I don’t go away the **Counselor** will not come to you. If I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment: About sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me; and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
>
>“I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak on his own, but he will speak whatever he hears. He will also declare to you what is to come. He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. Everything the Father has is mine. This is why I told you that he takes from what is mine and will declare it to you.

## The Belief

### Believe in the Holy Spirit: He is Fully God

- He shares the same attributes of the Father and of the Son

>>The Lord our God is but one only living and true God; whose subsistence is in and of himself, infinite in being and perfection; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself; a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; who is immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, every way infinite, most holy, most wise, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will for his own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withal most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

>>[1689.2.1 The Attributes of God](https://theologic.us/posts/confession-1689/1689-2-1-the-attributes-of-god/)

### Believe in the Holy Spirit: He is Self-Sufficient

>>God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself all- sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them; he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain; he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands; to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

>>[1689.2.2 The Sufficiency of God](https://theologic.us/posts/confession-1689/1689-2-2-the-sufficiency-of-god/)

### Believe in the Holy Spirit: Yet, he is not the Father nor the Son

>>In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word or Son, and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided: the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son; all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him.
