> More than ever I believe in preaching as a part of worship in the gathered church.

In the small church it does not become conversation or &#8220;sharing.&#8221; In the megachurch it does not become hype and jingles. Preaching is worshiping over the Word of God—the text of Scripture—with explanation and exultation.
