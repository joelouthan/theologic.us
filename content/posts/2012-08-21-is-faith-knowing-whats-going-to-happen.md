The last stage he loses sight of is the infinite resignation. He really goes further, and reaches faith; for all these caricatures of faith, the miserable lukewarm indolence which thinks, &#8220;There surely is no instant need, it is not worth while sorrowing before the time,&#8221; the pitiful hope which says, &#8220;One cannot know what is going to happen … it might possibly be after all&#8221;–these caricatures of faith are part and parcel of life&#8217;s wretchedness, and the infinite resignation has already consigned them to infinite contempt.

Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense there is nothing I can learn from him but astonishment. If people fancy that by considering the outcome of this story they might let themselves be moved to believe, they deceive themselves and want to swindle God out of the first movement of faith, the infinite resignation. They would suck worldly wisdom out of the paradox. Perhaps one or another may succeed in that, for our age is not willing to stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine, it goes further, it turns wine into water.

Søren Kierkegaard. [_Fear and Trembling_][2], 2012. Kindle 388.
