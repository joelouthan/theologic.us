Either I was following the course of this world or I wasn’t.

Either I was following Satan or I wasn’t.

Either I was a son of disobedience or I wasn’t.

If I deny to be any of those things or pretend I was not that bad off, then God did not come to save me.

Luke 5:31-32 **And Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”**

What is life? Is it because I breathe air and have blood course through my veins? Animals do that. That cannot be life because our life ends in death. When we are born, we, as mankind, were destined to die.

Why did Jesus come into our world? To conquer sin? Sure, but that wasn’t a real problem to him. To conquer Satan and demons? Okay, but Satan and his demons are creature with finite powers and is subjected to the sovereign Lordship of God Almighty. To conquer hell? No, Jesus is Lord of all—heaven, earth and especially, hell.

Jesus came into our broken universe so that we might have life.

John 10:10 **The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.**

You might say, “But I was already alive.” But is this life? Life that results in death. Life that has pain, confusion, heartbreak, sadness, brokenness, and sin? Can that really be life?

Jesus goes on in the Gospel of John to show exactly what he has come to do for all of us. [<sup>1</sup>][2]{#return-note-910-1.simple-footnote}

Jesus’ dear sweet friend Lazarus was dead. Not just any kind of dead, but four-days-in-the-ground dead. The funeral was scheduled. The crying and yelling was on. Hearts were shattered.

Friends trying to dictate what God should have done. They are trying to figure out, “Why didn’t God protect Lazarus? Why didn’t God heal Lazarus? Why did God take away Lazarus?”

In other words, “If God was really here, Lazarus would not have to die!”

Jesus told his peeps before, “I have come so that they may have life and have it abundantly.” Jesus turns to us in all of our ‘God should have’s’, and calmly says, “I have come so that they may have life and have it abundantly. Don’t try to debate Ecclesiology with me right now. Listen to me. I have come so that you might have life right now and have life abundantly right now.”

In other words, “Do you want to see the glory of God?”

Christ&#8217;s tear ducts drained from his cries. His beard soaked with sorrow. His face flushed with sadness. His throat raw from anguish. He turns what appears to be facing his long dead friend. In actuality, Christ turns to look into the eyes of Death himself. Christ wipes the tears from his face. He looks over the split of two destinies that loom over his sweet friend: one into death and one into life. He unflinchingly stares down right at Death and gives the command, “Roll away this stone.”

Jesus Christ, Word Incarnate, Majestic Savior, and Triune with the Father and Spirit, cries out with loud voice and calls out, “Lazarus, come out!”

At one time, Lazarus followed the course of this world.

At one time, Lazarus followed Satan.

At one time, Lazarus was a son of disobedience.

At one time, Lazarus was dead.

However, the Sovereign Almighty Lord of Grace, Love, Mercy, Righteousness, Faithfulness, and Holiness would not abide by Death. Instead, He called out to his friend, whom he knew and love before the foundation of the world was in place, and spoke life into him.

We were once dead in our trespasses and sins.

We were once following the course of this world.

We were once following Satan.

We were once sons of disobedience.

However, the Sovereign Almighty Lord of Grace, Love, Mercy, Righteousness, Faithfulness, and Holiness would not abide by Death. Instead, He called out to you, his friend—his friend whom he has known and loved before the foundation of the world was in place, and spoke life into you.

Do you trust Him? Do you believe Him? Do you take God at his word? Then you are God&#8217;s and God is yours forever.

Ephesians 2:1-10 **And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.**
