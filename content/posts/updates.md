## From Podcasts to Commentary Set

**Sunday, May 8, 2022** - So here's the real deal: the Internet at my rural home in Kentucky is a struggle bus. By God's good grace, it is good enough for my wife and I to get work done during the day and we can stream a movie at night. But live streaming and/or uploading videos is a real chore.

So I had to step back and look at the bigger picture: what do I really want to do. What I figured out is that the podcast/videos/"radio" episodes is really just an extension and the effect of the writing.

So what is the purpose of writing? One, when God gives me the grace to preach his word, I will be ready. But writing these sermons is really my worship to God. Whether anybody sees it or it ever gets published, it matters not because I know He will see it. And then pondering and praying more about it--my favorite commentaries have always been the ones you can read cover-to-cover. R.C. Sproul's St. Andrew's set or Preaching the Word from Crossway come to mind. 

So I will do just that. Let this writing and preparing not be accidental but purposeful. Let me be intentional of turning all of these writings into a Bible commentary set. (I think the term is "running commentary".)

Now that I have a goal and a purpose, I know what I am aiming for. And the best part is that I can still end up recording and broadcasting episodes later on if there is grace to be had.
