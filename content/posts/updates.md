## FINISHED: Devotions on the Gospel of Mark

**Wednesday, February 8, 2023**

Last post in the Mark series will publish on 2/17.

With finishing up [Mark](https://theologic.us/series/devotions-mark/) and soon to finish [Romans](https://theologic.us/series/study-romans/), I will not be starting any new series. This will allow me to hyper focus down on expositing the [1689](https://theologic.us/tags/1689/), which has been a massive undertaking. Case in point, I hit nearly 10,734 words on [2.1 The Attributes of God](https://theologic.us/posts/confession-1689/1689-2-1-the-attributes-of-god/).

### New Series: The Apostles Creed

So I said I wouldn't start a new series but these one doesn't count. I am doing a Bible Study with my son, Yusef, and teaching him the Basics of the Christian Faith. In other words, when we say we are a Christian, what are we saying that we believe. There is a basis of faith for the profession Christian and that is Jesus Christ our Lord.

I will do so by expositing the [Apostles' Creed](https://theologic.us/series/doctrine-apostles-creed/) and leading the Bible Study every other Friday night (started 2/3/2023) on [Discord](http://discord.theologic.us). Come join us!

## Backing off: Bible Survey & Switching from WCF to 1689

**Tuesday, October 18, 2022** - So I just got the word from the elders that we will make the transition from Calvary Chapel to Reformed Baptist 1689 2nd London Baptist Confession by the end of the year.

I am going to put the Survey on hold and go back to weekly expositions of the Westminster Confession.

For those who do not know: All the confessions are essentially the same chapters. The chapters on Baptism will be differing between those denominations who practice infant baptism (Presbyterians & Anglicans) and those who practice faith baptism (Baptists).

I thought and prayed about this for a while. I have decided to switch gears and convert my work from expositing the WCF to the 1689 because of where my church is going. The work so far will not be in vain. And I think it would be wise to continue using the resources that I have been using for the WCF.

(Be prepare for some transitioning. 1689/WCF section might be a little messy for a moment. -Ed.)

## Pastorals: FINISHED

**Thursday, September 8, 2022** - First volumes on the [Epistles to Timothy & Titus](/series/gospel-nt-pastorals/) is done! Praise be to my God.
