## Pastorals: FINISHED plus OT/NT Survey

First volumes on the [Epistles to Timothy & Titus](/series/gospel-nt-pastorals/) is done! Praise be to my God.

I had a pastor friend of my, Alex, who is preaching and evangelizing in Kenya, asked me to come teach the Bible to him and his pastor friends.

I wasn't sure if I would have the budget for such an adventure at least for a couple years. More so than that, what could I teach?

So I will write out a Survey on the Old and New Testaments. That will be the new Tuesday series.

## Stripping the Media links

**Tuesday, September 14, 2022**

I have prayed and meditate on this decision for a long while. I decided to strip the media links to the individual post. I will keep the links to YouTube, Twitch, Podcasts on the home page.

What does this mean?

Doesn't mean I won't keep recording and broadcasting. Honestly, externally going over my notes (i.e. blog posts) helps me know the word of God even more so--to dwell and meditate on him night and day. 

What it does mean that the recordings are not the main focus of Theologicus. This site, my blog, my recordings' main focus is to know the word of God. Ergo, honestly, nothing more than a really big bag of study notes.

## From Podcasts to Commentary Set

**Sunday, May 8, 2022** - So here's the real deal: the Internet at my rural home in Kentucky is a struggle bus. By God's good grace, it is good enough for my wife and I to get work done during the day and we can stream a movie at night. But live streaming and/or uploading videos is a real chore.

So I had to step back and look at the bigger picture: what do I really want to do. What I figured out is that the podcast/videos/"radio" episodes is really just an extension and the effect of the writing.

So what is the purpose of writing? One, when God gives me the grace to preach his word, I will be ready. But writing these sermons is really my worship to God. Whether anybody sees it or it ever gets published, it matters not because I know He will see it. And then pondering and praying more about it--my favorite commentaries have always been the ones you can read cover-to-cover. R.C. Sproul's St. Andrew's set or Preaching the Word from Crossway come to mind. 

So I will do just that. Let this writing and preparing not be accidental but purposeful. Let me be intentional of turning all of these writings into a Bible commentary set. (I think the term is "running commentary".)

Now that I have a goal and a purpose, I know what I am aiming for. And the best part is that I can still end up recording and broadcasting episodes later on if there is grace to be had.
