## Theologicus Live: Now Five (5) Days a Week

Starting May 31, 2021, Theologicus is going live on [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us/) five days a week.

Here is the massive teaching schedule including both in-home and online:

 - **Sundays at 7PM at my home**: Come for the light dinner. Stay for the [Bible Study in Romans](/series/bible-study-romans). We will have sandwiches and soup and whatever else you can dig out from our pantry and fridge.
 - **Mondays 12PM and 5PM: [Bible Study in Romans](/series/bible-study-romans)** - At this moment, the at home study is a week or two behind the stream.
 - **Tuesdays 5PM: Doctrine Tuesdays** - We are kicking things off with How to Pray according to the [Lord's Prayer](/series/praying-through-the-lords-prayer/).
 - **Wednesdays 5PM: [Gospel Meditations in the Pastoral Epistles](/series/gospel-meditations-pastorals/)** - Continuing the gospel work through Paul's letter to Timothy and Titus.
 - **Thursdays 5PM: [Bible Study in Genesis](/series/bible-study-genesis)** - We kick things off with a time before Genesis 1:1.
 - **Fridays 5PM: [Home Devotions in Mark](/series/home-devotions-mark/)** - How to lead devotions in your home with family, friends, and neighbors.
