## Massive Updates

I have changed this site so much and forgot to post what is going on. Here we go.

### Posts within Series are in Chronological order

By default in any blog software in the world, they want newest post first. Since I have been blogging for about 14 years, I have never, ever wanted my posts laid out like that. I write in series or chapters and they only make sense if you start at the beginning and work your way through.

[Recent Posts](/posts/), [Categories](/categories/), and [Tags](/tags/) are posted like blog posts--newest to oldest. Check there for the latest and greatest.

### Twitch, Youtube, and Podcasting

I have decided to bring my posts to streaming media.

At the beginning, I thought that podcast was the way to go. To be honest, recording for podcasting is rough on me. I don't know if it is because I am worried about the post-editing process or the fact my braces are causing me triple dry month. I got geared up to do a daily podcasts with my [Bible Study: Romans(/series/bible-study-romans) but recording for podcasts beat me down. Much to my dismay, I shelved the podcasting idea.

But something kept drawing me to [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us/). While I love playing [StarCraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/), no one wants to watch me trudge through the metal leagues. (That would be gaming speak for "I suck!") so I really don't know why [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us/). But I had a couple people I follow do a sorta gaming-devotional hybrid. That made me want to try doing my Bible Studies live.

After I figured out [OBS](https://obsproject.com) and [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us/)--twisting and tweaking--and started streaming, something in me just got lit. Perhaps it was God that was drawing me to doing my studies live, but oh my goodness, I love live streaming. Like I did my Romans Study today at noon today and I just can't wait to stream again.

I wanna do one every day.

But... let me pace myself. So, here is the current schedule:

* **Mondays at 12PM** [Bible Study: Romans](/series/bible-study-romans)

* **Wednesdays at 5PM** [Meditations: Pastoral Epistles](/series/meditations-pastoral-epistles/)

* **Fridays at 5PM** [Family Devotions: The Gospel of Mark](/series/family-devotions-mark/)

Here is the greatest thing about using [OBS](https://obsproject.com) and streaming to [Twitch](http://twitch.theologic.us/) is because of the software, I am automatically recording the video. 

So I then post to [YouTube](http://youtube.theologic.us/). From there, I simple import the audio using GarageBand and post it into my Podcast.

Because I am streaming, I can post to three different medias.
