Here just the very small list of resources on Mark that I have found most helpful.

### It Goes Without Say

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DXb+atXsL.jpg" align="left" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without errorâ€”they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Crossway. 2016.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

### Commentaries

by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.

[<img src="https://www.toolsandapplications.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Bible+-by-Olive-Tree-app-icon.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com)I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

by R.C. Sproul.  
Reformation Trust Publisher. 2020.

This is fresh off the presses. I have read [Romans, John, Mark, Acts, 1 & 2 Peter, and Matthew](https://amzn.to/3jc5I02) from this set. I can easily recommend every single one of them.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Keep on truckin'.

by Norval Geldehuys.  
Eerdmans. 1951.

Do I know anything about this guy? Nope. A few Amazon reviewers thought he was super solid and a conservative theologian.

When I started up this series, I was hard up for good Luke resources. By God's pure grace and timing, this fell into my lap.  So I am going out with the horse I rode in on and keeping this as part of the stack.

by Darrell L. Bock.  
Zondervan. 1996.

I swear to beans I have more books from this guy. But a quick looksee on Amazon shows that he is a one-lane kind-of-guy. He knows his Luke-Acts. (Now that I think about it, I am getting him mixed up with *Daniel I. Block* who wrote [Ezekiel (NICOT)](https://amzn.to/3azIXiq).)

Anywho, yada, yada, yada, horse I rode in on.
