### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q.

>Luke 3:21–22 (CSB) When all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. As he was praying, heaven opened,  and the Holy Spirit descended on him in a physical appearance like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well-pleased.”

Are we to do it any different?
