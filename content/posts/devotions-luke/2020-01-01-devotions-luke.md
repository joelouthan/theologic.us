### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q.

>Luke 1:57–66 (CSB) Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she had a son.  Then her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her his great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.  When they came to circumcise the child on the eighth day, they were going to name him Zechariah, after his father.  But his mother responded, “No. He will be called John.”  Then they said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”  So they motioned to his father to find out what he wanted him to be called.  He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.  Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.  Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these things were being talked about throughout the hill country of Judea.  All who heard about him took it to heart, saying, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the Lord’s hand was with him.

>Jeremiah 1:5  Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.

>Psalms 22:9-10  Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother’s breasts.  On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother’s womb you have been my God.

>Ephesians 1:3-6 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,  even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love  he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,  to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.

>Romans 8:28-30 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.  And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.
