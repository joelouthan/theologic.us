### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q.

<pre>
  <b>Luke 1:46–55 (CSB)
  And Mary said: 
      My soul magnifies the Lord, 
      and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
      because he has looked with favor 
      on the humble condition of his servant. 
      Surely, from now on all generations 
      will call me blessed, 
      because the Mighty One 
      has done great things for me, 
      and his name is holy. 
      His mercy is from generation to generation 
      on those who fear him. 
      He has done a mighty deed with his arm; 
      he has scattered the proud 
      because of the thoughts of their hearts; 
      he has toppled the mighty from their thrones 
      and exalted the lowly. 
      He has satisfied the hungry with good things 
      and sent the rich away empty. 
      He has helped his servant Israel, 
      remembering his mercy 
      to Abraham and his descendants forever, 
      just as he spoke to our ancestors.</b>

>Revelations 15:3-4 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,  
>“Great and amazing are your deeds,  
>      O Lord God the Almighty!  
>      Just and true are your ways,  
>      O King of the nations!  
>      Who will not fear, O Lord,  
>      and glorify your name?  
>      For you alone are holy.  
>      All nations will come  
>      and worship you,  
>      for your righteous acts have been revealed."

Adam and Eve?

John the Apostle?

Paul?

Nebuchadnezzar?

>Daniel 4:28-35 (CSB) All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon, the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built to be a royal residence by my vast power and for my majestic glory?”
>
>While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you. You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.”
>
>At that moment the message against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.
>
>But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever:
>For his dominion is an everlasting dominion,  
>and his kingdom is from generation to generation.  
>All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing,  
>and he does what he wants with the army of heaven  
>and the inhabitants of the earth.  
>There is no one who can block his hand  
>or say to him, “What have you done?”

Who is like you, God?

>Daniel 5:18-22 (CSB) Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, greatness, glory, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar. Because of the greatness he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages were terrified and fearful of him. He killed anyone he wanted and kept alive anyone he wanted; he exalted anyone he wanted and humbled anyone he wanted. But when his heart was exalted and his spirit became arrogant, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken from him. He was driven away from people, his mind was like an animal’s, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky until he acknowledged that the Most High God is ruler over human kingdoms and sets anyone he wants over them.
>
>“But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this.
