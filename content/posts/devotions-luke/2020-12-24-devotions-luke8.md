Q. 9. How many persons are there in the Godhead?

### Christ Calls Us With the Gospel

>Luke 8:4-8 (CSB) As a large crowd was gathering, and people were coming to Jesus from every town, he said in a parable,“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some seed fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the sky devoured it.Other seed fell on the rock; when it grew up, it withered away, since it lacked moisture.Other seed fell among thorns; the thorns grew up with it and choked it.Still other seed fell on good ground; when it grew up, it produced fruit: a hundred times what was sown.” As he said this, he called out, “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen.”

When the gospel is preached, does it accomplish what God wants it to do?

Isaiah 55:10–11 (CSB)  
  For just as rain and snow fall from heaven  
    and do not return there  
    without saturating the earth  
    and making it germinate and sprout,  
    and providing seed to sow  
    and food to eat,  
  so my word that comes from my mouth  
    will not return to me empty,  
  but it will accomplish what I please  
    and will prosper in what I send it to do.”

Romans 1:16-17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

## 🏠Luke 8:9-15

### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 11. How doth it appear that the Son and the Holy Ghost are God equal with the Father?  
A. The Scriptures manifest that the Son and the Holy Ghost are God equal with the Father, ascribing unto them such names, attributes, works, and worship, as are proper to God only.

### Christ Calls Us By Giving Us New Hearts

>Luke 8:9-15 (CSB) Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”So he said, “The secrets of the kingdom of God have been given for you to know, but to the rest it is in parables, so that
>    Looking they may not see,
>      and hearing they may not understand.
>
> “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.The seed along the path are those who have heard and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.And the seed on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. Having no root, these believe for a while and fall away in a time of testing.As for the seed that fell among thorns, these are the ones who, when they have heard, go on their way and are choked with worries, riches, and pleasures of life, and produce no mature fruit.But the seed in the good ground—these are the ones who, having heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold on to it and by enduring, produce fruit.

Ezekiel 36:25-27 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.

## 🏠Luke 8:16-18

### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 12. What are the decrees of God?  
A. God's decrees are the wise, free, and holy acts of the counsel of his will, whereby, from all eternity, he hath, for his own glory, unchangeably foreordained whatsoever comes to pass in time, especially concerning angels and men.

### Christ Calls Us By Shining Into the Darkness

>Luke 8:16-18 (CSB) “No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see its light.For nothing is concealed that won’t be revealed, and nothing hidden that won’t be made known and brought to light.Therefore take care how you listen. For whoever has, more will be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”

John 1:1-5 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.He was with God in the beginning.All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.In him was life, and that life was the light of men.That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it.

## 🏠Luke 8:19-21

### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 13. What hath God especially decreed concerning angels and men?  
A. God, by an eternal and immutable decree, out of his mere love, for the praise of his glorious grace, to be manifested in due time, hath elected some angels to glory; and in Christ hath chosen some men to eternal life, and the means thereof: and also, according to his sovereign power, and the unsearchable counsel of his own will, (whereby he extendeth or withholdeth favor as he pleaseth,) hath passed by and foreordained the rest to dishonor and wrath, to be for their sin inflicted, to the praise of the glory of his justice.

### Christ Calls Us To Be Co-Heirs

>Luke 8:19-21 (CSB) Then his mother and brothers came to him, but they could not meet with him because of the crowd.He was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
But he replied to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear and do the word of God.”

Romans 8:14-17 (CSB) For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons.For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

A. God executeth his decrees in the works of creation and providence, according to his infallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable counsel of his own will.

### Christ Calls Us While We Are in the World 

>Luke 8:22-25 (CSB) One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he told them, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they set out,and as they were sailing he fell asleep. Then a fierce windstorm came down on the lake; they were being swamped and were in danger.They came and woke him up, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to die!”
>
>Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. So they ceased, and there was a calm.He said to them, “Where is your faith?”
>
>They were fearful and amazed, asking one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him!”

## Luke 8:26-39

### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 15. What is the work of creation?  
A. The work of creation is that wherein God did in the beginning, by the word of his power, make of nothing the world, and all things therein, for himself, within the space of six days, and all very good.

### Christ Calls Us While We Are Under Attack
>Luke 8:26-39 (CSB) Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.When he got out on land, a demon-possessed man from the town met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes and did not stay in a house but in the tombs.When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.

“What is your name?” Jesus asked him. “Legion,” he said, because many demons had entered him.And they begged him not to banish them to the abyss.

A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to permit them to enter the pigs, and he gave them permission.The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.

When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran off and reported it in the town and in the countryside.Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man the demons had departed from, sitting at Jesus’s feet, dressed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.Meanwhile, the eyewitnesses reported to them how the demon-possessed man was delivered.Then all the people of the Gerasene region asked him to leave them, because they were gripped by great fear. So getting into the boat, he returned.

The man from whom the demons had departed begged him earnestly to be with him. But he sent him away and said,“Go back to your home, and tell all that God has done for you.” And off he went, proclaiming throughout the town how much Jesus had done for him.

## Luke 8:40-56

### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 16. How did God create angels?  
A. God created all the angels spirits, immortal, holy, excelling in knowledge, mighty in power, to execute his commandments, and to praise his name, yet subject to change.

### Christ Calls Us Out of Disease and Death
>Luke 8:40-56 (CSB) When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.Just then, a man named Jairus came. He was a leader of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’s feet and pleaded with him to come to his house,because he had an only daughter about twelve years old, and she was dying.
While he was going, the crowds were nearly crushing him.A woman suffering from bleeding for twelve years, who had spent all she had on doctors and yet could not be healed by any,approached from behind and touched the end of his robe. Instantly her bleeding stopped.

“Who touched me?” Jesus asked.
When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.”

“Someone did touch me,” said Jesus. “I know that power has gone out from me.”When the woman saw that she was discovered, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people, she declared the reason she had touched him and how she was instantly healed.“Daughter,” he said to her, “your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”

While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader’s house and said, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”

When Jesus heard it, he answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be saved.”After he came to the house, he let no one enter with him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother.Everyone was crying and mourning for her. But he said, “Stop crying, because she is not dead but asleep.”

They laughed at him, because they knew she was dead.So he took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!”Her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he gave orders that she be given something to eat.Her parents were astounded, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.

What happened when sin entered into the world? What happened when Christ entered into the world?
```

Romans 5:12-21 (CSB) Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned.In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to a person’s account when there is no law.Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression. He is a type of the Coming One.

But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.And the gift is not like the one man’s sin, because from one sin came the judgment, resulting in condemnation, but from many trespasses came the gift, resulting in justification.If by the one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.

So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is justification leading to life for everyone.For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.The law came along to multiply the trespass. But where sin multiplied, grace multiplied even moreso that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
