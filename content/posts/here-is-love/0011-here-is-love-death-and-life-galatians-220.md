My life is not my own. My heart, my soul, my flesh, my mind, and my strength: all of it does not belong to me.

I used to think that it did belong to me. I use to the think that I was solely in charge of my own life, my own purpose, and my own destiny. But as the years rolled on, I noticed that the more and more that I tried to handle my life on my own, I was inching closer and closer to death—leaving a trail of destruction along the way.

Likewise, if I said I was alive by the fact that I think thoughts, or my heart pumps blood, then something is still missing. There is a chasm bigger than the Grand Canyon that exists inside of me. Life is not what I can see or experience. If it that is the case, then I know for a fact that those things will not fulfill this hole.

Truth of the matter is that I was not alive. I contend that I was not alive because life that ends in death is no life at all.

I was in full decay.

My soul was not free to live. My soul sank to the furthest most depths of the ocean. The massive, weighty force of freezing water sat on top of me painfully pressing my soul. My own sin was crushing me and I had no strength to lift any of it.

But the good, holy, righteous, loving and only God and Savior cuts through my sin with his strong arm and lifts me up from the pit of hell. And God has not simply rescued me from my filth in order to be emptied corpse washed upon the shore. My gracious, merciful, and just Lord breaths life into me, opened my eyes, strength to my atrophied muscles, love in through my veins and infinity in my heart.

Okay. Now I live.

Now I trust in what Christ has done, is doing and will do by the power of His Spirit for the Glory of His Name.

Christ saw my sin, depravity, wickedness, deceit, anger, lust, frustration, perversion, ignorance, treachery, and blasphemy. He wasn’t stupid. He wasn’t ignorant. He saw of that and loved me. I was far from him and in his almighty power, he exchange his place near to God for my place far away from God so I can be near God forever.

Galatians 2:20 **I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.**

That is love.
