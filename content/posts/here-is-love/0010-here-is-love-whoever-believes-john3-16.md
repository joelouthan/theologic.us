God loves us. So much so, He came to us.

The one who thinks of themselves as good or even, not-so-bad thinks that this is acceptable. “God should come to us. Why shouldn’t he?  God should come to me and meet me and get to know me and love me and save me despite me.”

However, you see, to the renewed mind, the first line of John 3:16 _almost_ doesn’t make sense.

**For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son,**

Is this the same God who does not tolerate our sin? In other words, if we have but one drop of sin, we cannot dare approach the throne of God. It’s not that we can work really hard to _try_ to put one foot in front of the other sinful foot in order to get that much closer to God. No. It doesn’t work that way. If the Bible is true then because of the sin in our lives, we cannot face in the direction of God and thus, have no way of approaching God.

I guess we could try walking backwards but how would you know if you are heading in the right direction? Answer: you don’t know. And running into God is not some random encounter.

God knew that.

He knew that you weren’t going to turn to him. He knew that you were not good. He knew you were not seeking after him. He knew you would not understand. He saw the worse in you.

And God loved you.

God absolutely knew that you would not make it to Him on your own. Instead of being a cruel and torturous deity whose follows have no chance to be with him, he is the only True God that comes after you instead.

Like a Best Friend who wants to be with His friend.

Like a Lover who wants to be with His love.

Like a Husband who wants to be with His bride.

Like a Father who just wants His child with Him.

He comes after us.

He thought about it. He planned it all out. He sent His Son to come get us. He empowered His Son with His Spirit so that He could complete the task.

He did this before He laid the foundations of the earth and before the realms of the heavenly places. He did this all before Genesis 1:1.

He was still part of the plan. You were still part of the plan. Sin didn’t make our God go into a scramble panic alert. The Plan is still in effect.

_Wait, how do we know if we are saved?_

**that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.**

How does that read?

Whosever believes and _does not believe_ should not perish but have eternal life?

Does Romans 1:16 say that the gospel is the power of God in salvation to everyone who believes and _doesn’t believe_? Are the storehouses of God filled with the wheat and _the chaff_? Are his fields filled with the sheep and _the goats_?

No,

The Plan is that God saves sinners.

Not a random crap shoot but a 100% successful rescue mission.

You believe in this? You trust in this? You give your life for this?

If the answer is yes, then praise God that he unlocked the handcuffs, flung open the dungeon doors, gave sight to your eyes, unblocked your deaf ears, switched out your stony heart for a soft heart that loves, clothes you in righteousness, gives you His seal and lets you walk in the peace of the His good news.

You will not perish.

You will have eternal life.

You will have the fullness of joy.

You will have pleasures forevermore.

You will be completely satisfied.

Because you are Christ and Christ is in you.

Christ bridged the gap of infinity between the heart of God and the heart and man as the angels looks upon us in amazement and wonder and testify:

That is love.
