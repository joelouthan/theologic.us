Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.**

_What is this hope?_

Walk backwards from the text. Our hope in adoption as sons? Redemption of our bodies? That creation would be set from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God? The revealing of God's glory? Heir of God? Fellow heir of Christ? The Spirit bearing witness that we are children of God?

See the pattern?

But all of those things that we long for and desire and hope for are found in Christ alone.

He is our declaration of no condemnation.

He is our condemned sinful flesh.

He is our righteous requirement.

It is His Spirit by which we live, move and have our being.[^1]

It is His Spirit that dwells in us.

It is by His Spirit that we have been given life.

But Christ is someone we don't see. Likewise, we cannot see the Father nor the Spirit. Because we can't see him, we long for him. Like long distance lovers. Like husband off to war waiting for the day to come back home to be with his wife. Heck, like the guy who has to go to work 8 hours a day and fight hours of traffic just to be with his woman. Like the gal who goes out of town on business who just can't wait to be with her baby.

In that waiting, we are not impatient as a kid wanting ice cream after dinner. We know we can't see God right away but one day, we will. And when we see him, He will wipe away all of tears, make all things right, give us the fullness of joy and pleasures evermore.
