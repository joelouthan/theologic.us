For here is love: **Genesis 3:15**
**I will put enmity between you and the woman,**
**and between your offspring and her offspring;**
**he shall bruise your head,**
**and you shall bruise his heel.**

And here is love: **Deuteronomy 7:6-8 “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.**

And here is love: **Psalm 103:15-18 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.**

And here is love: **Lamentations 3:22–23**
    **The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases;**
        **his mercies never come to an end;**
    **they are new every morning;**
        **great is your faithfulness.**

And here is love: **Ezekiel 36:22-28 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.**

And here is love: **Matthew 1:21 She shall bare a son and you shall call his name Jesus for He will save His people from their sins**

And here is love: **John 1:16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.**

And here is love: **John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.**

And here is love: **Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.**

And here is love: **2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake, He made Him to be sin who knew no sin so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.**

And here is love: **Romans 9:25-26**
**… Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’**
**and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’**
**And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’**
**there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’**

And here is love: **Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.**

And here is love: **Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.**

And here is love: **Romans 8:38-39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love God in Christ Jesus our Lord.**

And, **1 John 4:10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**

The world and Satan and his demons are so desperate to try to get you to believe something wholly incomplete about love.

Love is a feeling.

Love is a verb.

Love is an emotion.

Love looks like this.

But in the times we live today, love is being redefined as this: "What the Bible says is a sin is not a sin because the God of love would never do that."

And yet, what the Bible says: if you believe and trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, then God has taken **all** of your sin, wickedness, and trespass and placed them on Jesus Christ to be crucified and buried forever.

My friends, we do not have to attempt to cherry-pick our sins and take them back from the cross. If I trust in Christ, then my sins do not belong to me. They belong to Him. And since our sins are buried with him (Romans 6), they stay dead. Sin is death, not life. Our sins stay dead because sin is not holy like our God.

Only if you turn to, believe, and trust in the Holy One of God who alone has the words of eternal life.

What the world fails to know and what Satan wants to keep from you: God loved us so much that he was willing to do whatever it took to bring His people back to himself.

And if that meant God's only begotten Son, would have to die an excruciating death upon that cross on that hill of skulls, then he would please to send His Son, place our sins upon him and crush him for those whom he thought, seen, knew and loved infinitely before the foundations of the world were in place.

Likewise, Jesus Christ, Son of God, who is God, would gladly be obedient to His Father with the joy that was set before him, nailed Himself to that tree all for the sake of atoning, bearing punishment for, cleansing, removing, and saving His people from their sins.

And again, Christ could only live as we should have lived, died the the death we should have died, and be resurrected as we cannot, and ascended to the right hand of His Father as only he can only by the power of the Holy Spirit, who, the only God that searches everyone and violently removes the hearts of stone and replaces it with God's own soft heart of love.  The Spirit himself gives Himself, God's saving grace, everyday mercies, steadfast love to His people.  And in turn, the Spirit is only one worthy enough to seal us forever and bear witness that we are the children of God.

Do not listen to Satan, demons, and the world when they try to change what God has said. Moreso, your thoughts, anxieties, and idols have no power to save you.

God has shown to the world and has made it perfectly plain: God is love.

Trust Him right now and believe. Be saved to him today. Don't waste a second of your life doing otherwise.
