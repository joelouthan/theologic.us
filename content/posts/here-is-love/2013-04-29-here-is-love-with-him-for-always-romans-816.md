_What can I say when I am in the presence of the Almighty God?_

I have no defense!

All of my works of righteousness are as used bloody tampons before God.

Everything I did before knowing God was regarded as crap.

This is what I hold in my hands, bloody tampons and shit, before the incredible, awesome, magnificent, glorious Creator God of the Universe, who is high, lifted up, and exalted far above me, my thoughts, my pride, my sin, my iniquities, and my pitiful gods.

I try to catch a momentary glimpse of my sweet Savior’s face but He is too bright and my eyes are too bleary. I turn away and I see a thousand fall at the Judge’s side and ten thousand fall at his right, screaming out in amazement, “Lord, Lord! Look at everything I done in your name?!” The Lord stands and eternally sentences, “I never knew you and you never knew me. Depart from me!”

I don’t even have works done for His name sake? What can I bring?

But my soul is at peace. This is the moment I have been waiting a lifetime for. I have been brought to the throne of judgment. My knees give out. I lay face down before him. The floor fills with my hot tears. Yet, my mouth opens to cry out for nothing. Nothing comes out. Not even a screech. I sat bathed in his holiness and righteousness and I have no defense to give to my great King.

But His Holy Spirit, whom Christ said, “He will bring to remembrance everything I have taught you”, pulls in closer and whispers tenderly to my soul and spirit, “I am here. I am always here. Do not worry about speaking. I will speak for you.”

And with a quiet, still, soft voice that cuts through shrills of the unbelievers, “Father, this is your child.” The Judge who sits upon the Throne of Judgment but also upon the Throne of Grace and Mercy, turns to His Father and with a slight smile, asks, “Father, what do you say?”

And the elders look upon and stare in awe. And the creatures bow in humility. And the heavens stood still for a moment as the Father of lights booms voice in absolute certainty, “**This is my son in whom I am well pleased!**”

My beautiful, glorious, majestic Savior stands before the all the witnesses and every creature and pronounced the eternal proclamation, “**NO CONDEMNATION! You are mine and I am your Beloved forevermore. Now come, enter in the joy of your master.**”

I tell you all of these things so that your joy may be full.

I tell you all of these things so that you know you are loved.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong>Series</strong>: Intrigued by the postmodern oft-used answer of “God is love”, by just by digging a little deeper, what I have learned is that people usually mean, “Love is God”. But this begs the question: what is love? To that end, I began writing a series that answers that question.</span>
