_What does it mean to be a child of God?_

To ask that is to ask: What does it mean for the Father to set his affections upon you? What does it mean for Christ to love you, pursue you, die for you, and then live for you? What does it mean for the Spirit to lead you and to bear witness for you? What does it mean for us to cry out, “Abba, Father” to God and to have the Creator of the Universe turn and focus on you?

What does that mean to you?

“_Well, I don’t feel like it_.” Thankfully, His salvation is not dependent on you or your feelings. I know my children may feel like they are not my kids especially when I have to correct them. But in that correction and discipline, all of my affections, love, and admiration are focused on that child. Even so, my correction is imperfect. How much more love, attention, and admiration does the Perfect Father have each of us? How perfect is his attention upon us?[^1]

“_Well, I don’t see any riches_.” You mean unrighteous wealth? Why would that be your focus, your intent, and the target of your yearnings? God has set his affections upon you. Why would you turn away from the source of all pleasure and joy? Why would you separate yourself as the fellow heir to the one who is the heir of all things?[^2]

“_How do I know I am saved_?” My child, do you believe and trust in God? I am not talking perfectly—I am talking if at all? Where do you think you got the power to believe? Where do you think your faith comes from? Within yourself? If my faith comes within me, surely I will have failed and falling away. But my God is supremely good and preserves his saints by giving each of us a measure of that faith—the same faith that was authored and perfect by our Lord Jesus Christ.[^3]

Your ability to believe does not rest on anything you are—not your wisdom, intelligence, schooling, knowledge, might, or wealth—but rests solely, completely, entirely, utterly, truly, perfectly on who God is and everything He has done for us.

Because of what He has done, we are his children. We cannot be turned away. We will not be rejected. But that doesn’t mean we are neutral in the middle of nowhere by ourselves alone. In addition, we shall be received in his love. We are to enter into the joy of our Master. We are raised to glory forevermore according to the sovereign and free grace of our Father through the broken bloodied body of His Son by the power of His Spirit.

Because of who He is, all are ours. We have it all because He is our All-in-all.

**1 Corinthians 3:21-23 So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.**

He is our all. Because of Him alone, here is all the love.
