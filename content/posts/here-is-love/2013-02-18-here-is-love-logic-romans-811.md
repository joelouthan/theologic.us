_What is certain?_

This is certain: if you have the Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from dead, dwells in you, you have life.

How can we be certain that we have the Spirit of God in us? How can we know? Can we know?

**On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.** [][2]{#return-note-1868-1.simple-footnote}****

Wait, what about now? Is Jesus Christ glorified now? A little while later in John’s Gospel, we read:

**When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.** [][3]{#return-note-1868-2.simple-footnote}****

So how do we get this Spirit? How do I have the Jesus-Christ-raising Spirit of God in me?

**And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.** [][4]{#return-note-1868-3.simple-footnote}

So, if I change my mind about my sin and about sin itself, and turn to God, I will receive this gift of the Holy Spirit. Is it possible that God would say, “No” to me because I have sinned too greatly?

**And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”** [][5]{#return-note-1868-4.simple-footnote}****

Wait a second! What about blaspheming the Holy Spirit? Christ said that blaspheming the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin. (Matthew 12:31-32] Is it possible that I blasphemed the Holy Spirit?

**I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.** [][6]{#return-note-1868-5.simple-footnote}****

You were ignorant of the Holy Spirit. How can you blaspheme someone you do not know? First, you would have to know the Holy Spirit and specifically attack and blaspheme the Holy Spirit. Did you do this? Did you know the Holy Spirit or _thought_ you did?

However, you ask these questions. Do you think these questions come from your intelligence, emotions and will or from God on high?

**He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.** [][7]{#return-note-1868-6.simple-footnote}

Here is logic:

  1. For you to live, you must have the Spirit of God in you.
  2. For you to receive the Spirit of God, all you need to do is turn to God and ask Him.
  3. If you ask Him for His Spirit _or_ in other words, if you go to God, ask for God, you are going to get God.

God, in his infinite power and awesome might, does not possess the ability to deny Himself to those who have turned to Him ask Him for Him. We could call that ‘inability’ to deny Himself to those who would ask for Him. However, instead of _inability,_ the correct term would be love. In other words: Because God is love, God will not and cannot deny Himself to those who turn to Him and ask for Him. You are going to get Him. What else can we say to that? That is love.
