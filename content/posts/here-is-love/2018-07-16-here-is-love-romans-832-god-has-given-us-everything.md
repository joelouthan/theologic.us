  Romans 8:32 <b>He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I could sit here and blast you with God’s holy words about God alone provides for us, and we need nothing.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Psalm 23:1" id="return-note-3702-1" href="#note-3702-1"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is more than “I don’t want” like we are monks in Timbuktu living off the land but rather, because God adopted us, we are co-heirs with the One who has inherited all things.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, </b><i> </i><b>and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Romans 8:16–17" id="return-note-3702-2" href="#note-3702-2"></a><i> </i><b>Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, </b><i> </i><b>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Hebrews 1:1–2" id="return-note-3702-3" href="#note-3702-3"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But is it that simple? To live in the world that we do now?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  As an American, I live in the wealthiest land not only now but of all time. But are these verses right for me as my brother or sister on the poor side of town or in the run-down rural town not even fifteen miles from where I am sitting now?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And we even know that God “<b>makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.”</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Matthew 5:45" id="return-note-3702-4" href="#note-3702-4"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  There is a disparaging difference between the rich and the poor or how we are finding out now, depending on which zip code you were born and lived. Nevermind the fact that God alone determines what time you would be born but what socio-economical status aka your zip code you would be born into just so that you would seek God. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Acts 17:24–26" id="return-note-3702-5" href="#note-3702-5"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Now, I remembered being homeless just in the last 18 months. But I now live in the most beautiful home I have ever seen in my life. I also remember when I made minimum wage. But I also remember when one year God doubled my take-home pay the proceeded to steadily increase my salary by 20% on average for seven years straight.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And I tell you, and I promise it wasn’t because I sowed some seed into a ministry. It wasn’t because I was living righteous. It wasn’t because I was paying tithes faithfully. It was none of the pragmatical reasons that you might try to figure out right now. You might think you are asking, “How can I get that?” but if I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>know the American mind, what you are truly asking is, “How do I get God to do that for me?”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Let me tell you what exactly I did:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Up until last year, I was in a marriage where I was under constant abused. But unfortunately, I was too emotionally and mentally immature and ignorant to realize it until years later. When I started therapy, I was initially diagnosed as a narcissist but then rediagnosed later with Bipolar Disorder before finally and correctly being diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Yet, the abuse and stress too me to such a dark place that I contemplated suicide. I even placed a chef’s knife against my jugular in front my of then wife and my two oldest children.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But God spared me. And God continued his healing upon my heart and mind.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But then when God did grant me peace, you know how I responded? I ran away from him promising to live a life of apathy and debauchery. (For those keeping score, this was just little over a year ago.)
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But God ran after me and saved me again. And not only did God continue his work, but God also finished his work of healing upon my heart and mind.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So, listen to all of the prosperity “gospel” preachers who lie through their teeth and try to tell you that God will give you riches and make you healthy if you would just give money to their ministry. I pray that God would save these people who lie about who God is—otherwise they are twice the children of Satan and the judgment would be far worse if they never attempt to preach one syllable in their lives.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You listen to what they have to say, and then you examine my life when God blessed me in every way.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But you see, if we think of money or houses or jobs or things, then our thinking is so tiny and small.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And I tell you, when my thinking of His perfect provision more right-standing with Him and His word, you cannot convince me otherwise that He has blessed me more than any other person who has ever lived or will ever live.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  For you see, my friend, He has given me His Son, Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You might reject this because it is an easy answer. I assured you when the Father gave up His Son so that His children are saved to Him, that was not easy! We do know that Christ gave up his Spirit and the Father pour his wrath upon His Son—the two most God-awful things that will ever happen to a person. But Isaiah says, &#8220;It pleased God to bruised his Son.&#8221; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Isaiah 53:10" id="return-note-3702-6" href="#note-3702-6"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And what&#8217;s even more incredible than that? Jesus Christ wanted to give his life up for mine.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Galatians 2:20" id="return-note-3702-7" href="#note-3702-7"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And Christ went to the cross and hung himself there with great joy for my sake so that I would be set free in Him. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Hebrews 12:1-2" id="return-note-3702-8" href="#note-3702-8"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Paul speaks all the time about being content. Paul speaks of having everything and nothing and content with just the same. But I think every one of us now has a tough time grasping that concept. Heck, bills have to be paid. Car needs to be gassed. Clothes on kids wear out. We always need food and water. And none of that comes cheap nor easy.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But I hope that we can each pray the prayer of the wealthiest man of all time:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, </b><i> </i><b>lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Proverbs 30:8–9" id="return-note-3702-9" href="#note-3702-9"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  and pray this for always:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  In Christ, you have given me so much that heaven and earth can give me no more.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I hope and pray that we would be content with having everything because we have Christ. And because we have Him, we shall not want.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  God has provided all because He is a perfect Father who loves his children.
