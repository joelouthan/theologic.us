Here is love:

>Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

I am confident that 99.8% of people reading this was born in the 20th century. Historically speaking, Christ died about 2000 years ago. I am going to link these two ideas in one moment.

Christ is fully God. That means He fully sees all and fully knows all. This goes beyond what you and I can see. We might stand in one room, look around and see all that we can see but we know that there are certain things that can our block our views. We can’t see everything in the room or better yet, we can’t see everything within everything in the room. That is not a problem for God. In your house, he clearly sees—not crystal ball see or video camera see—but clearly sees everything within everything in all of your rooms. Lights on or off, it doesn’t matter. As for the everything within everything, he also sees what’s going on inside your body. Further still, he sees what’s going on inside your mind, your emotions, your will, and your desires.

What makes God really God is not that any one moment he chooses to see all these things—from the dust bunnies behind your desk to deepest darkest recesses of your heart—but rather, he continuously, actively, fully processing all those things all the time.  He can’t shut that off. He is God. He _has to_ fully know everything for every moment of every day since time began. For Him to be God, He has to know every single thought, motivation, and desire you have ever had or will ever had.

You were born some time in the 1900s or if you are so happened to read this a few years from now, 2000s. If Christ was historically crucified some 2000 years ago and as a believer, he died for yours sins, then that means that before you were born, before you could do anything about any of your sins, Christ died for you.

Look at the verse again: **but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.**

Here is the good news: that verse never says, “but God shows his love for us based on all the good stuff we did and the bad stuff we didn’t do, Christ died for us.” It certainly never says, "God shows his love for us in that time he saw that I went forward in church, said the sinner's prayer, Christ died for me." It clearly says, "**while we were still sinners"**.

There is no other religion, no other faith that makes these claims. The rest of the world wants you to try really hard to be perfect, do the right thing and don't do the wrong things.  But God says, “You are going to fail because I know. I already know. Even when you do good things, you sometimes do them for the wrong reason. Even when you had good intentions, sometimes it goes bad. I already know.”

In other words, He looked upon me and saw that I was a horrible guy. He looked at my life and knew I was going to die apart from him. He saw that by my birth and by my choice, I was destined for destruction, decay, disease, and death.

He saw everything about me. He saw it all, and despite my worst, he chose me and loved me anyways and went ahead sent His Son to die for me so I could be with Him instead.

That is love.
