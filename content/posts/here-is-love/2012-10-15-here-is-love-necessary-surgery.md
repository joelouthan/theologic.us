[<sup>1</sup>][2]{#return-note-944-1.simple-footnote}

**This is the unquenchable thirst of holiness**: He will do so by saving His people from Him, by Him, for Him, through Him, and to Him forever and ever. [<sup>2</sup>][3]{#return-note-944-2.simple-footnote}

**This is the weight of the glory**: His word will be preached among the dead—the valley of dry bones—and  because He is life, he speaks life into the dead and those who were once dead, now they shall live! [<sup>3</sup>][4]{#return-note-944-3.simple-footnote}

**This is His will**: our sanctification. He will cause us to walk in His statutes and be careful to obey Him. This is not that we would behave well but so that we will be facing and connected to the Source of life so that in His presence we will have the fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore for His glory forevermore. [<sup>4</sup>][5]{#return-note-944-4.simple-footnote}

**This is how He will do it**: the Skilled Physician performs open heart surgery on each and every one of his precious children and places His life-giving Spirit into every heart opened by Him:

Ezekiel 36:22-28 ** “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.**

We were once dead. Good news: Jesus is alive. The same Spirit that raised Him from the dead is life because of righteousness. If that same Spirit that raised Him from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal, feeble, decaying bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you. [<sup>5</sup>][6]{#return-note-944-5.simple-footnote}

Vacuum to Breath of Life. Decaying to Growing. Sickly to Invincible. Death to Life.

By the Spirit alone and with the new breath, we proclaim:

That is love.
