  Romans 8:29<b><i> </i>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. </b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This entire series has been trying to pit the world’s definition of love versus God’s definition of love. And perhaps up until this moment, we have never taken that to actual task. What I mean by that is that comparatively speaking, if I speak of God’s love, we can still find something like that in on earth.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  For example, the laughter of a tiny infant to their parents’ goo-goo and gah-gah sounds. Some would say that would be joy, innocence, and love. But not much more that. Or when we challenge oppressors in hopes to give liberty to the oppressed, that might be out of justice and love, but what else could that included.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  We could come up good lists of what different loves look like but none would be as complete as the love of God. I contend that the reason why is because while we do things out of love, God does something even greater than that—He does everything out of his glory.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Think for a moment and try to come up with a definition for the word ‘glory’. Consider Webster’s:
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">
    high renown or honor won by notable achievements.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    magnificence or great beauty.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    praise, worship, and thanksgiving offered to a deity.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    luminous ring or halo, especially as depicted around the head of Jesus Christ or a saint.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    take great pride or pleasure in.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p1">
  But according to the Bible, it speaks of God’s glory as each of his attributes to the <i>maximum infinite degree</i>. I say both maximum and infinite because to suggest <i>maximum</i> might suggest a limit somewhere. To say infinite says there is unlimited potential, but we can fall short of that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In who God is—whether it be love, mercy, justice, holiness, righteousness, presence, strength, knowledge, or grace—God is maximum unlimited.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So when we say “God saved us out of love”, that is true but is far much more than that. I can say that with utmost certainty because you see, God is perfect and was never was or will be in sin and thus, everything that he does is never out of good intentions or in hope of but completed perfectly to the end. Consider our born state and the world we live in: many times, while we might do our best to do things out of love, we either fallen short with good intentions or do so with selfish gain.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Take any book of the Bible, look for the mention of the glory of God and see what I am saying. For instance, in Luke we see that:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory in the mere ability of God becoming man, Jesus</b> &#8211; Luke 2:8-21 And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory in His all-knowledge and all-wisdom</b> Luke 4:15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory again in His all-power over brokenness </b>Luke 5:25-26 And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory in his all-power over death </b>Luke 7:16 Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and “God has visited his people!”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory in all-justice </b>Luke 9:26-27 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.” (See Revelation 19:11–21]
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s glory in His command of time</b> Luke 9:32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>God’s even in the death of Jesus Christ upon the cross </b>Luke 24:26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Why did God save? Because he loves us but more so than that, because He is glorious!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Consider this: if God was not for his glory, then he would cease to be God. Remember, until we see our Savior completely face to face, we will never know perfection on this side of heaven. (Some pastors say you can obtain perfection while on earth and I am here to tell you that they are wrong). But what if we were without sin? That is so impossible to imagine but that is what God is. And in his absolute perfection, He operates within the maxed out of his attributes. He operates in glory.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To put this in another way, God does not have to lessen something that he is his in order to do what he wants. He doesn’t suppress his righteousness and holiness in order to love us. He doesn’t have to suppress his love in order to be fully holy. No, not at all! But sometimes we want him to let off his righteousness and holiness? Don’t we? Like “Lord, thank you for eradicating all of my sins but how about don’t work on this little sin deep in the recesses of my heart. How about leave that alone? I need my pride, my lust, my fear, my vanity because that is who I am!” How crazy is the notion that we would want God to grade on a curve or overlook this one little sin in our hearts? Don’t you want to be with the God who has ZERO SIN in and around him which automatically equates to perfect peace, fullness of joy and blissful pleasures forevermore? If God allowed sin in his presence—yes, even our “itty bitty little” sin— then we would still have sickness, disease, despair, death, broken hearts, some joy, some love, and mediocre pleasures in a short amount of time. Doesn’t that already sound a bit familiar? (Hint: look around you.)
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But because God is glorious—in other words, because God is fully, perfectly, one-hundred percent-ly all the things that the Bible says he is, then it is because His glory that we are saved.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Isaiah 48:9–11
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <b>“For my name’s sake I defer my anger;<br /> for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you,<br /> that I may not cut you off.</b>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <b>Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver;<br /> I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.</b>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <b>For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,<br /> for how should my name be profaned?<br /> My glory I will not give to another.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And yet from this one prophet, consider how he was saved:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Isaiah 6:1-7 <b>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;<br /> the whole earth is full of his glory!”</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  How do we know this to be the glory of God? Jesus said so:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  John 12:41 <b>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Praise God for his perfection and glory.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Praise God for his ability, willingness, and actually completed his salvation of His people.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Praise God for his absolutely amazing love!
</p>

  <b>Series</b>: Intrigued by the postmodern oft-used answer of “God is love”, by just by digging a little deeper, what I have learned is that people usually mean, “Love is God”. So we then have to ask, <i>what is love</i>? This series is my attempt to answer that question as theologically and biblically as possible.
