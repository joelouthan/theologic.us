>Romans 8:9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.

In modern times, we tend to talk about mankind’s achievements and possibilities. To the modern mind, humans have achieved so much and therefore, mankind’s possibilities are endless. Likewise, to the individual, we can achieve anything. All we need to do is to work hard enough and get a good education.

Did your mom tell you that? My grandmother certainly did: “You can do anything if you set your mind to it.” We can all becoming the President, lawyers, doctors, or millionaires or whatever we want.

But once we stopped thinking like a child, we quickly realized that we can’t do whatever we “set our minds to”. I could have been in hockey all of my life but that would have not turned me into a NHL player. We have all quickly figured out that individuals have _gifts, talents _and _desires_ and this coupled with focus and will is what shapes us into what we want for ourselves.

But what about absolute truth? What about knowing who God is or even, if there is a God? What about being saved to God apart from this God? Can we achieve even these things?

Ah, the modern yet _broken_ mind falls tragically short of being able to _actually_ know God. This is where our free wills lack the power to close in on the infinite distance between us and God. This is where the highest IQ or EQ gets you no closer to God than one crippled with a brain injury that left him with the mental capacity of a two year old.

Can we obtain absolute truths? This is where the post-modern starts off right. We can’t. However, they like to throw their hands up and quit trying. Absolute truths are held by God who is the source of all truths. Absolute truths include God, his love, his being, his purpose, and his will. And the only way for you or I or any of the billions upon billions of people who have lived or will ever have lived know the absolute truth of God is _if_ God and God alone reveals Himself to us.

The wise and the foolish.
The strong and the weak. 
The rich and the poor. 
The black and the white. 
Nothing of what you were born into or achieved in this life will obtain God. 
However, to his imagebearers. 
To the ones he created in the image and likeness of Himself. 
To ones who were led astray. 
To the ones who were born under His wrath. 
To the ones who are far from him—

He sent His Son Jesus Christ to live as we should have lived—by the power of the Holy Spirit—and died, buried and rose from death in our place for our sins. It is the same Spirit that descended from God himself and rested upon Christ is the _same_ exact Spirit that reveals the love and glory of God. It is the same Spirit that opened up your eyes to see God. It is the same Spirit that opened up your ears to hear God. It is the same Spirit that unclouded your mind in order to know God. It is the same Spirit that removed your heart of stone and gave you a new soft heart from God so that you would have new desires and your new desires are for Him.

Apart from God, we cannot get God. I sincerely hope you know that. Not many people do know that or they live their lives in such a way that they can achieve God as though He is some sort of endboss in a video game. God alone has to _reveal_ Himself to you and you cannot possibly dwell on God and want God without God giving His Spirit to you.

Without Him, we are apart from Him. With Him, we get to have Him and enjoy Him forever.

Stop thinking and doing things in order to achieve Him. In order to receive God, all you got to do is ask for Him. If you ask Him for Him, he will always say, “Yes”:

**Luke 11:9-10 And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.**
