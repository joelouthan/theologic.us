And here is love:

>Deuteronomy 7:6-8 “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

I get the fact that I am not a Hebrew. I am not an Israelite. I get that God had certain promises given to Israel that he did not give to Gentiles. I get all of that.

However, when I read the New Testament, I cannot be so quick to dismiss or downplay the Old Testament. I read Jesus’ account of the Vinedresser, Paul’s exposition of that particular teaching, Paul’s further clarification on the offspring of Abraham, and Christ’s confirmation that all of the Scriptures are about Him. Based on that string of logic, I am left to conclude that “Father Abraham had many sons and many sons had Father Abraham.” Furthermore, if you and I are saved by Christ, then “I am one of them and so are you.” (So, let us just praise the Lord.)

All that to say: when I read this passage in Deuteronomy, I cannot dismiss this as some obscure Jewish fact. This passage applies to me.

**For you are a people holy to the LORD your God** - This is simple enough. I am holy because God is holy. (1 Peter 1:16; Leviticus 11:44]

**The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples**. - Of course, I am just one person. I am a born sinner. My family name is not that great. My city and country are not supreme over all historical cities and empires. I am but a mere mortal—not the strongest, not the richest, not that wise, and not that smart. Only because of Him for him by Him to Him that **out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth**, He has chosen me. While I was a sinner and I kept on dying and kept on sinning, Christ loved me and gave his life up for me. I have no room to boast. Salvation is of the Lord alone and He is the mighty one to save. (Romans 5:12-21; Jeremiah 9:23-24; Romans 5:8; Galatians 2:20; Jonah 2:9; Zephaniah 3:17)

**it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers** – God set his love, thoughts, mercies, affections, grace upon me. He did infinitely before he made one promise to either of my fathers Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, or David. He had his mind made up, He alone had the audacity, power, will, freedom, might, boldness, humility, holiness, righteousness, perfection, just, and love to save me. He handed down those covenants and He is the only being in this universe that cannot possibly lie or break a promise. (Hebrews 6:17-18)

**that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand** – He is the mighty one that saves. (Zephaniah 3:17 cf. Isaiah 63:1; Romans 7:24-25)

**redeemed you from the house of slavery** – I have not been given the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but as a son of God, I have received the Spirit of Adoption by whom I cry, “Daddy!” (Romans 8:16)

**from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.** – Jesus conquered, defeated, and reigns supreme over Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death. (Colossians 2:15; Hebrews 2:14-18; Romans 8:28-39)

Way before I was even born, before the heavens were made manifest, the earth was formed, the seas filled and the mountains put into place, He saw my destiny of disease, destruction, decay, and death and would have none of that. In His infinite power and might, He _predestined_ me to life with Him, fullness of joy in His presence, and unlimited pleasures forevermore. (Psalm 90:2; Ephesians 2:1-10; Psalm 16:11]

Simply put, the greatest love ever known is not the possibility of salvation by God but that in God _actually_ saves. That guaranteed salvation of love is wrapped up simply and completely in one little verse:

**And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.** Romans 8:30

So what shall we say to these things?

That is love.
