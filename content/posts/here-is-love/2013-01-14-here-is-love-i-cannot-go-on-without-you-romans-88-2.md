> Romans 8:8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

_Is this true?_

**We have all become like one who is unclean, 
and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. 
We all fade like a leaf, 
and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.**[^1]

**as it is written: 
"None is righteous, no, not one; 
no one understands; 
no one seeks for God. 
All have turned aside; 
together they have become worthless; 
no one does good, 
not even one."**[^2]

**for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,**[^3]

Would it not be the very definition of love if God would let us decide how to be saved apart from His just wrath? Would it be lovely of the Father that we got to choose which path we got to go to God? That within the _brokenness_ of our minds, in the _rottenness_ of our bodies, and in the death-nay, the _non-existence_-of our spirits, that we possessed the right amount of goodness in order to choose God and approach God to ask God to save us?

Logically, think about it. If you are trying to get to God, then how can you do that without God? In other words, if the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, how is that possible if your spirit is dead? Who can the Spirit of God bear witness about when there is nothing to bear witness about in the first place? Furthermore, if we do not have His Spirit, how can we understand the gifts that are given to us by God, namely, His Son, Jesus Christ? If we have no spirit but just the flesh, then we cannot comprehend the Spirit.

There are many spirits of this world. But that's just it, these spirits are _of the world_ and they do not point back to God. There is one Spirit that is not only of God by God for God but much more, He is God and that is the Holy Spirit.

What hope do we have without the Spirit? Our only hope and the hope of the entire world rests upon whom the Spirit descended from heaven and rested upon and that man is Jesus Christ.

Do you want to speak about love? In the greatest love ever, God sent His begotten Son, Jesus Christ, in order through him the world might be saved. Not might as in mere possibility but might as in "now they will be saved". For all those who would believe in Christ Jesus and call upon His name, He has been mindful of them, loved them from forever, thought about them, yearned for them, and fell in joyous love with them as He paved a way to the cross so that He could go back to the Father and that the Father would send His Spirit to them who believed in Him.

The Father knew that even if the humans had infinite IQs, they would never be able to figure out how to get to God.

The Spirit knew that all of our good works could not overcome the depths of sin with our hearts and that there would be no way we could commune with God.

The Son knew all of this and being the Only God with the will, love, and power to save, He saved us according to His own mercy and by His great love.

We don't have a lot of choices for a joy-filled, endless pleasurable life. In fact, there is only one Way and that is Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. It might be the only Way but think about this: it is the sure-fired Way. It is such a rock-solid guarantee that not even the omnipotent God himself can undo the Way because order for God to take away that Way, he would have to undo or remove Himself. Logically, He set it up so that you know there would never be any way of God going back on what He has done. Some would call that genius. Others would call that relief. For the entire world, that is what we call love.
