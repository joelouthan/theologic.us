<pre><blockquote>
  My God,
  
  It is the might and strength of your protection on my life and heart that gives me peace.
  
  That no other thing in all of creation can ever separate me from you in the name of your Son, Christ Jesus my Lord.
  
  Nothing ever compares to you. You alone are powerful and worthy.
  
  Thank you for protecting me.
  
  Thank you for loving me.
  
  Thank you for calling me your own.
  
  And now I am safe because I will get to be with you forever.
