**Mark 1:16-20 Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.**

When we are saved, when we accept Jesus into our hearts and trust in Him and trust what he says, there are a ton of things that God did before we could even know who God is.

God knew you.

God loved you.

God created you.

God pursued you.

And God called you.

Just like the disciples here, Jesus Christ called them one by one, telling them to all, "Follow me." Likewise, when we heard about God for the first time and when we heard about what Jesus did for those who trust and believe in Him, His Holy Spirit was calling out to each other hearts, saying, "Follow me.".

_When do you remember the first time you felt God calling you?_
