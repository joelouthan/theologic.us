Here just the very small list of resources on Mark that I have found most helpful.

## It Goes Without Say

![Christian Standard Bible](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1535917156&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=theologicus-20&language=en_US)
[**The Bible**](https://www.amazon.com/CSB-Outreach-Bible-Bibles-Holman/dp/1535917156?crid=1X4PIPYH6DDM1&dchild=1&keywords=csb+bible&qid=1619795755&sprefix=CSB+%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-4&linkCode=li3&tag=theologicus-20&linkId=b946558cfa0fe688e43bc1648d735a77&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il) Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

![ESV Study Bible](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1433524619&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=theologicus-20&language=en_US)
[**ESV Study Bible**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1433524619?&linkCode=li2&tag=theologicus-20&linkId=2c7acb245df24de2bdd7463dc5d664a9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il) Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over.

If I had to pick just one, I use it way more in my [Olive Tree Study Bible](https://www.olivetree.com) than anything else.

![Mark (New Testament Commentary) by William Hendriksen](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0801041147&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=theologicus-20&language=en_US)
[**Mark (New Testament Commentary)**](https://www.amazon.com/New-Testament-Commentary-Exposition-According/dp/0801041147?&linkCode=li2&tag=theologicus-20&linkId=1ec35be41362244096463baede18683f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il)  
William Hendriksen
1981, Baker.

Sheer luck (aka sheer blessing from God) that I ran into a small incomplete set of Hendriksen's Commentaries at my local [Half Priced Books](https://www.hpb.com/). I have never heard of this guy and the only facts I could find out about him was from [Wikipedia](william hendriksen commentary online).

From the article:

> In his influential work Israel and Prophecy, written a year after the 1967 war, and still in print, Hendriksen criticized the view, held by dispensationalists and Christian Zionists, that the Bible prophesies the return and restoration of the Jews to the land of Israel.[^1] Dispensationalist pastor Barry Horner describes Hendriksen's work as "a classic representation of replacement theology".[^2]

Make no bones about it: it grieves me to the core that Dispensationalism is the auto-default eschatology of too many American Evangelical churches--including every single church I have ever attended in my life with the exception of the church I attend now. It saddens and frustrates me that I was born into a church that automatically taught a doctrine that was born within the 20th century. But as with anything, theology and doctrine are to be taught and never assumed.

That said, that one little blurb in Wikipedia and knowing there was one (1) pastor who bucked against Rapture theology, Hendriksen forever became 'my boy'.

![The Gospel of Mark (NICNT) by William L. Lane](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0802825028&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=theologicus-20&language=en_US)
[**The Gospel of Mark**](https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-according-Mark-Introduction-International/dp/0802825028?dchild=1&keywords=mark+by+william+lane&qid=1612371379&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=theologicus-20&linkId=a62b781f63a312bf8ae91f7f2f5d7d20&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il)  
William L. Lane  
1974, Eerdman's.

Incredible thorough and wonderfully written, Dr. Lane walks the reader masterfully through not only the Gospel but the perspective of the writer, John-Mark.

![Calvin's Commentaries](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0802808026&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=theologicus-20&language=en_US)

by John Calvin (Writer)

I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about $40.

by Thomas C. Odin & Christopher A. Hall (Editors)  
2005, IVP Academic

I think this entire series is an excellent resource to have on hand if you can pony up the scratch.  It's all fine and good to read guys from within the last few centuries. But how about reading commentary from within the first few centuries after the ascension of Christ. You ain't going to read anything shockingly new.  But what you are going realize there is absolutely new under the sun and Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
