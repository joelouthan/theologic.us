If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. But no one can enter a strong man&#8217;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.**

_Is Satan a god?
  
_ **     Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel
  
** **          and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:
  
** **     “I am the first and I am the last;
  
** **          besides me there is no god.
  
** (Isaiah 44:6 ESV)

_Is Satan as strong as God? Is Satan as powerful as God?_

_Who created Satan and the demons?_

_Are we created? Are we creatures?_

_Can Satan beat God?_

_When was Satan defeated?_

And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. **This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.
  
** (Colossians 2:13-15 ESV)

**Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
  
** (Hebrews 2:14-15 ESV)

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
