## The Text

>Mark 1:4-8 John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

## The Devotional

There are things we do in the church that are so important and so sacred. They are the utmost importance and these are things we should not do lightly. This is baptism and communion.

Communion is something that our church does every week. But do all people in the church take communion? No. Only those who believe, trust, and obey Jesus Christ as their God and Savior.

Likewise, does everybody in the church end up being baptized? No. Look at what Paul writes in Romans 6 about what it means to be baptized:

>Romans 6:1-5 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection.

To put your faith, trust, belief, faith, and obedience into Christ means that all of yours sins--past, present, future--are placed on the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. When Jesus was then buried in the tomb, he took those sins with him.

>Romans 6:23 (CSB) For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Christ, who is holy, perfect, and righteous and who has never sinned, is risen to life by the power of God the Holy Spirit.

To be baptized is the utmost serious. That means that you are telling the world that you are choosing to follow Christ rather than yourself. Will you do it perfectly? No. Will you try to wander away? Yep. But this is where you realize it is not what you did or didn't do to save yourself but rather all that God did to save you.

## The Discussion

1. What do you think John meant by “Christ will baptize you with the Holy Spirit”? 

2. What does it mean if the Holy Spirit (Spirit of God) is in your heart and with you always?
