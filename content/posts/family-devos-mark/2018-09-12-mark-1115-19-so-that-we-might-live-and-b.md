**Mark 11:15-19 And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. And when evening came they went out of the city.**

Isaiah 56:1-8
Thus says the LORD:  
“Keep justice, and do righteousness,  
for soon my salvation will come,  
and my righteousness be revealed.  

Blessed is the man who does this,  
and the son of man who holds it fast,  
who keeps the Sabbath, not profaning it,  
and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”  

Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say,  
“The LORD will surely separate me from his people”;  

and let not the eunuch say,  
“Behold, I am a dry tree.”  

For thus says the LORD:  
“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,  
who choose the things that please me  
and hold fast my covenant,  
I will give in my house and within my walls  
a monument and a name  
better than sons and daughters;  
I will give them an everlasting name  
that shall not be cut off.  

“And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,  
to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD,  
and to be his servants,  
everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,  
and holds fast my covenant—  
these I will bring to my holy mountain,  
and make them joyful in my house of prayer;  
their burnt offerings and their sacrifices  
will be accepted on my altar;  
for my house shall be called a house of prayer  
for all peoples.”  

The Lord GOD,  
who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares,  
“I will gather yet others to him  
besides those already gathered.”
