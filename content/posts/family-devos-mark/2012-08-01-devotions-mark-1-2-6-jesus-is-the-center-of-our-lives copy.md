## The Text

>Mark 1:2-6 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,  
>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,  
>who will prepare your way,  
>
>the voice of one crying in the wilderness:  
>‘Prepare the way of the Lord,  
>make his paths straight,’”
>
>John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.

## The Devotion

Several hundred years before Jesus stepped foot on the earth, there was a man named Isaiah who was charged to foretell or prophesy about Jesus. But within that prophecy was another prophecy about a man named John that would "pave the way" for the Lord.

John was special in that he was the last prophet before the coming of Christ. But he was no more special than any believer in the Bible that is called to point our words, actions and our lives back to Christ.

## The Discussion

```text
1. What do you think it means to point my life to Christ?

2. What do we do with our words when we speak to one another? How can we make our words point back to Christ?

3. If the Old Testament is about Christ, what is the New Testament all about?
