## The Text

>Mark 1:12-13 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.

## The Devotional

>Romans 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.

Was Jesus human?

Was Jesus the Son of God?

Did Jesus have in him, the Spirit of God?

Do we have the Spirit of God?

Are we sons and daughters of God?

Does God love his kids?

Does God love you?

## The Discussion

```text
1. What does it mean to have the God in my heart?

2. What first must happen for God to be in my heart?

3. What does it look like to be led by the Spirit? Do you think the Spirit will lead us where He led Jesus?
