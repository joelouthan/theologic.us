Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.” But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.” **

_1. Did King Herod knew Jesus?_

&nbsp;

_2. Can Jesus and John be the same guy? Is Jesus Elijah? Is Jesus just a prophet?_

&nbsp;

**     “Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. **(Malachi 3:1 ESV)

**     “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.**
  
(Malachi 4:5 ESV)

John 1:19-28 **And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”**

**     (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.**
  
Isaiah 40:3 **A voice cries:
  
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD;
  
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.**

&nbsp;

_3. Did John get raised from the dead?_

&nbsp;

_4. Will John get raised from the dead?_

&nbsp;

_5. Will we get raised from the dead? Why?_

Romans 8:11 **If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.**

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
