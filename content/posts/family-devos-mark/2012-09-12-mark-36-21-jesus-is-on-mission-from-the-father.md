**     The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.**

_&#8230; but fail and fail again because Christ is life._

&nbsp;

_People wanted to make him king because he makes food &#8220;magically&#8221;_

**     Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. **

_&#8230; but Jesus had so much more to give—eternal life._

&nbsp;

_Despite the masses that wanted him to heal them, so few wanted to be his disciple_

**     And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. **

_&#8230; but Jesus wants you to be with Him._

&nbsp;

_Demons wanted to try to mess up the mission of God_

**     And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.**

_&#8230; but demons cannot mess up God&#8217;s plan because Jesus completely rules over demons._

&nbsp;

_Jesus reveals the 12 dudes that will walk with him, when others won&#8217;t:_

**     And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach and have authority to cast out demons. He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.**

&#8230; _Therefore, we are no less than the 12 disciples of Christ. We are to go and preach his good news and with his authority, expand His kingdom and press up against the gates of Hell._

&nbsp;

_His family said, &#8220;Jesus is out of his mind&#8221;_

**     Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.”**

_&#8230; but the mind of Father, Son, and Spirit are one._

&nbsp;

_Religious leaders said, &#8220;He is filled with demons&#8221;_

**     And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.” **(Mark 3:6-22 ESV)

_&#8230; Jesus is not filled with demons but filled with the Holy Spirit. The work of demons and the work of God are two different things. One is out for your death. The other is out of love for your joy._

&nbsp;

Jesus had just one mission: from his Father with the power of His Spirit, he came to earth to save His people.

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
