Mark 8:27–30 **And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.” And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.**

  1. In what ways does Jesus show us who God really is?
  2. What did Jesus come here to do?
  3. Can there be any other way to God?
  4. What happens when we get God?
