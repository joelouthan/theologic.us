**Mark 12:35–37 And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared,  
  “‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
  “Sit at my right hand,    
  until I put your enemies under your feet.”’**

**David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son?” And the great throng heard him gladly.**  
  
Daniel 7:9–14    
  “As I looked,  
  thrones were placed,  
  and the Ancient of Days took his seat;  
  his clothing was white as snow,  
  and the hair of his head like pure wool;  
  his throne was fiery flames;  
  its wheels were burning fire.  
  A stream of fire issued  
  and came out from before him;  
  a thousand thousands served him,  
  and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;  
  the court sat in judgment,  
  and the books were opened.
  
“I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.  
  
  “I saw in the night visions,  
  and behold, with the clouds of heaven  
  there came one like a son of man,  
  and he came to the Ancient of Days  
  and was presented before him.  
  And to him was given dominion  
  and glory and a kingdom,  
  that all peoples, nations, and languages  
  should serve him;  
  his dominion is an everlasting dominion,  
  which shall not pass away,  
  and his kingdom one  
  that shall not be destroyed.  
  
Romans 8:30 And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.
