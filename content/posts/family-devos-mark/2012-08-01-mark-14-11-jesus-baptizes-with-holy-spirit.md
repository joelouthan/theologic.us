And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&#8217;s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” **

_What do you think John meant by “Christ will baptize you with the Holy Spirit”?_

_What does it mean if the Holy Spirit (Spirit of God) is in your heart and with you always?_

**Parents**: I know I am assuming a lot when it comes to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, not knowing your religious background, upbringing or your church&#8217;s stance on the Holy Spirit. Parents, simply do a word search on the Spirit (as oppose to spirit, see Romans 8:16) and talk about this distinct person of the Holy Spirit. Emphasize, while we can&#8217;t see him (like the Father), he is fully God and does a real work in our hearts when we are saved to God.

**Note:** I originally posted this as Mark 1:4-11 and suddenly remembered that passage better serves as two distinct conversation: _Who is the Holy Spirit_ (this post) and _What is the Trinity?_ (next post). For posterity sake, I have taken the liberty of updating the old post, splitting into two, re-titling both and posting up. Sorry for the confusion. Enjoy. &#8211;_Ed._

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
