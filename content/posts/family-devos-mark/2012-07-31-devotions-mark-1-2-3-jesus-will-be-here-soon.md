## The Text

>Matthew 1:18-21 (CSB) The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, it was discovered before they came together that she was pregnant from the Holy Spirit. So her husband, Joseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce her secretly.
>
>But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

>Mark 1:2-3 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,  
>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,  
>who will prepare your way,  
>
>the voice of one crying in the wilderness:  
>‘Prepare the way of the Lord,  
>make his paths straight,’”

## The Devotion

This is a prophecy made 400 years before Christ ever arrived.

Jesus said it himself:

>Luke 24:27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, Christ interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Think of another Bible story. How does that story sound like Jesus?

2. What was the first prophecy in the Bible that said the Messiah was coming?
```

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring.  
>He will strike your head,  
>and you will strike his heel.
