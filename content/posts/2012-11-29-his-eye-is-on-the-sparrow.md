<pre>Why should I feel discouraged, 
why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, 
and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
<em>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</em>

“Let not your heart be troubled,” 
His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, 
I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, 
when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

<em>I sing because I’m happy,
I sing because I’m free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</em></pre>
