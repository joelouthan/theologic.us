Luke 1:46–55 And Mary said,
      “My soul magnifies the Lord, 
      and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
      for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. 
      For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; 
      for he who is mighty has done great things for me, 
      and holy is his name. 
      And his mercy is for those who fear him 
      from generation to generation. 
      He has shown strength with his arm; 
      he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts; 
      he has brought down the mighty from their thrones 
      and exalted those of humble estate; 
      he has filled the hungry with good things, 
      and the rich he has sent away empty. 
      He has helped his servant Israel, 
      in remembrance of his mercy, 
      as he spoke to our fathers, 
      to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”

    And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 

      “Great and amazing are your deeds, 
      O Lord God the Almighty! 
      Just and true are your ways, 
      O King of the nations! 
      Who will not fear, O Lord, 
      and glorify your name? 
      For you alone are holy. 
      All nations will come 
      and worship you, 
      for your righteous acts have been revealed.”

Adam and Eve?

John the Apostle?

Paul?

Nebuchadnezzar?

Daniel 4:28–35 **All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, and the king answered and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?” While the words were still in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.” Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers, and his nails were like birds’ claws.**

**At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever,**

      for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, 
      and his kingdom endures from generation to generation; 
      all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, 
      and he does according to his will among the host of heaven 
      and among the inhabitants of the earth; 
      and none can stay his hand 
      or say to him, “What have you done?”

Daniel 5:18–22 (ESV) **O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty.** **And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled.** **But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.** **He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will.** **And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,**
