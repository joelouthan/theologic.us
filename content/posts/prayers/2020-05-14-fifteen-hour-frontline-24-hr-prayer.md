**Prayer Today**

**Yusef and Nichole** - Acts 2:38–39 And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” This is the promise that you gave to your son as you gave me a new heart and your Spirit. I am wholly dependent on you to save my children. But I pray and beg and plead that you save Yusef and his mom and her family. I know your word. I know the sower. If Yusef gladly receives the word, his house will choke the seed and let it die. Save, sanctified, redeem, and glorified--you are the only one who can do this.

**Elijah & Ivy, Amber& Kara, Griffen, Gabe, Emma, Lacey, Grace, Lucy** - I am not going to figure out why the two households of my children are eerily similar. All I see is double the salvations, double the households, and double the miracles. But you, O Lord, are not limited in power and might. You are the Almighty--infinite in might to save, continuous in kindness, and abounding in steadfast love. I am asking for exponential salvations. I ask you to save everyone in their household. If the blessings of me fall upon my children no matter where they are at, then I know those blessings are without end. Because you are my Lord and my God--the source of all of my joy and pleasure forevermore.

**Natalie, Jackson, Kingston** - I continue to ask for the impossible. Save Mormons? Save those who think they walk in holiness because of their own righteousness. You soften their hearts! Then save them! Help them to not place their faith their works lest they may boast. But to put their faith into Jesus Christ the only Savior. 

**Reed & Sandy** If you save their daughter and grandchildren, then save their family. Save the Mormon Church. Oh, I pray that in my lifetime, I will see the Mormons marked with repentance and revival and a zeal for my Father's house. I have seen this in denominations and sects. I have seen you fold into your flock. You are not weak but mighty. Your arms are not short. Save them, King Jesus.

**Johnny & Jamie, Kolton, Korbin** You saved me! Consumed with lust and perversion. I was twice the son of hell--moreso than my dad. My brother is consumed with rage. It will destroy him. But you are the only one who makes all things right--because you sent your Son to put death, Satan, sin, demons, and hell to open shame. I pray that my brother is not consumed by his unrighteous wrath but praise You for you pour out your holy wrath upon your Son--to bear the sin, shame, guilt, torment, weight of his people and save them *perfectly, completely, and definitely.*  Who is like you, Lord?

**Jeanny** I don't know where she is but save her. If she has minutes to spare, then take her heart! Give her yours! That she would love you and be with you for all of eternity. Praise your holy name!

**Jodi & Ryan, Piper, Rylee** - My Lord, do not let fear consume my sister Jodi. I pray that you deliver her and her family out of darkness and despair. I was once deep in the pit of darkness but my soul knows that Christ is deeper still. Save Jodi. Save her family.

**Jennifer & John; Brandon; Phillip & Keri; Pedigo & Deb** I praise you for the blessings that you have given to this family. I know they know something about you. But I don't know if they love you. Their happiness and blessings can only come from you. My God, bless them and I thank you for preserving them through everything. Thank you for keeping their family together.

**Melissa & Micah, Noah, Levi, Judah** - I am done with judging his soul. I cannot. I am tired of seeing the fruit of self-righteousness and hard-heartedness. Preach the gospel to his heart. When weeds have choked your words, choke the weeds. When the birds of the air devour the seed, kill the birds. Just save Micah. Thank you for keeping Melissa and the boys in your loving grace. May Micah see the grace and kindness that you have given to his family and it will cause him to repent and seek your face for all of his days.

**James** The heart is hard. He does right in his own eyes. But you are the God of everlasting to everlasting. I know you humble the proud. I know you will do what it takes to save him. Have your will in his life.

**Jason, Molly**  - Save his soul, my God. Save her soul. Let one's testimony cause the other to repent. Save them. I don't know them but save them.

**Jansen & Mandy** - You gave him a new heart. Now, give him a new heart. Help him see your grace.

**Sean & Sunny** - God, draw them closer to you. How can I help in this? Keep communication always open. Strengthen our relationships. Help us be a blessing to them.

**Evan**. - I pray for Evan. Save his soul. Quiet his soul. Grant him a new heart.

**Steph & Ken, Ella, Sam** - in the midst of turmoil and rage and evil, God, you are Lord above. Swoop in and save each of them.

**Mark & Nicole, Gabrielle** - It was a honor to get to work with Mark. I know he doesn't believe in you. But you still save. Save him and his house.

**Mark & Robin** - thank you for letting me know him. Save him and Robin. Bless them.

**Friends**

**Alix & Braden** - Which God is good? None like you. Thank you for finally bringing them together. Help them to grow in intimacy and help them to communicate. Also, to ask for help when they need it. They are not alone.

**Dena & Dave** - I thank you for my sweet friends. Lord, you have blessed them and their children and their children's children. Give them the sweetest favor. But be with them now.

**Reva & Ronnie** - However they are, let them know you are near and dear to them. I thank you Lord for their lives and their friendship. Bless them.

**Sarah & Josiah** - What joy can be contained when it comes from you? It cannot. You alone put them together. I don't want to use this term but I pray the blessing of the power couple - they only live in the fear and love of their God and no one else. Their eyes will be glued to your face. They will not stop until they are resting in your arms.

#### Cities

**Nornan** - Our roots are doubled. I pray that they run deep. I pray that we can minister to this city for all of our days. I pray for a real revival--one that will bear witness to every single one of your children. One where this whole city repent and rejoices for all of their days.  To all the churches, may every single of your ministers preach Christ and him crucified with every chance they get. Lord, in my city, be glorified today.
