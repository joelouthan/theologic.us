## Leaders within Frontline

Lord, would you raise up even more leaders for Norman. No matter what direction we take please tap more leaders.  More musicians. More of your Son in each of us so it won’t be dependent on any of us but on you alone.  

Lord, be glorified in our homes and in our city. Today.

# Frontline Norman

Lord,

I believe I have your vision. I do not desire a ministry. My only desire is to faithfully handle your precious word and preach the gospel of Christ and him crucified.

But not my will but your will be done.

Amen.
