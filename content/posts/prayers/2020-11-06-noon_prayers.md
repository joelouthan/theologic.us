<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">BLESSED SPIRIT OF GOD,
</div>
Four evils attend my ministry —
      The devil treads me down by
  discouragement and shame
    arising from coldness in private meditation.
Carelessness possesses me
  from natural dullness and dimness of spirit;
    because in the past I have met with success
      and been highly regarded,
    so that it does not matter if I have now failed.
Infirmities and weakness are mine
  from want of spiritual light, life and power,
    so that souls have not been helped,
      and I have not felt thee to be near.
Lack of success has followed even when
  I have done my best.
But thou hast shown me that the glory of everything
  that is sanctified to do good
    is not seen in itself,
    but in the source of its sanctification.
Thus my end in preaching is to know Christ,
    and impart his truth;
  my principle in preaching is Christ himself,
    whom I trust,
  for in him is fullness of spirit and strength;
  my comfort in preaching is to do all for him.
Help me in my work to grow more humble,
  to pick something out of all providences
    to that end,
  to joy in thee and loathe myself,
  to keep my life, being, soul, and body
    only for thee,
  to carry my heart to thee in love and delight,
  to see all my grace in thee, coming from thee,
  to walk with thee in endearment.
Then, whether I succeed or fail,
    nought matters but thee alone.
</pre>

**Isaiah 61 (ESV)**

**The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,**

**because the LORD has anointed me**

**to bring good news to the poor;**

**he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,**

**to proclaim liberty to the captives,**

**and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;**

**to proclaim the year of the LORD'S favor,**

**and the day of vengeance of our God;**

**to comfort all who mourn;**

**to grant to those who mourn in Zion—**

**to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,**

**the oil of gladness instead of mourning,**

**the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;**

**that they may be called oaks of righteousness,**

**the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.**

**They shall build up the ancient ruins;**

**they shall raise up the former devastations;**

**they shall repair the ruined cities,**

**the devastations of many generations.**

**Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;**

**foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;**

**but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;**

**they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;**

**you shall eat the wealth of the nations,**

**and in their glory you shall boast.**

**Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;**

**instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;**

**therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;**

**they shall have everlasting joy.**

**For I the LORD love justice;**

**I hate robbery and wrong;**

**I will faithfully give them their recompense,**

**and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.**

**Their offspring shall be known among the nations,**

**and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;**

**all who see them shall acknowledge them,**

**that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.**

**I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;**

**my soul shall exult in my God,**

**for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;**

**he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,**

**as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,**

**and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.**

**For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,**

**and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,**

**so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise**

**to sprout up before all the nations.**

# All the churches in Norman

> **John 10:11-18 (CSB) “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand, since he is not the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, leaves them and runs away when he sees a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches and scatters them. This happens because he is a hired hand and doesn’t care about the sheep.**

> **“I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”**

# Frontline Norman

> **Matthew 9:35-38 (CSB) Jesus continued going around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness. When he saw the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”**

Lord, every second of every day I must ask you: what is mine to do. I confess and repent that I don't turn to you. Lord, be gracious to me.

My God, give me your Spirit. Give me the fullness of the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Moreso than for me to preach your word but to turn my heart and cleanse my heart and make me just like you. 

Draw me closer. Let the world die to me so I can live to you.

# Discipleship Group

Lord,

There is an full assault on your sons and daughters. Satan and his demons and the world is waging against us and it is all out.

God, you shall protect us because you are our shield.

But Lord, just like the mighty men of David, we are here to fight our sin and choke it with our bare hands until it dies.

We need your salvation. You have to cover us with your righteousness. Give us the call the strap our feet with the gospel of your peace. We need the gift of faith. We need your word.

Magnify and glorify Christ in us. 

Shatter the gates of hell.

I love you so much.

# City of Norman

- Mayor Breea Clark
- Councilperson Elizabeth Foreman

I pray against attacks on our leaders. Shield their eyes and hearts.

But Father, if they do not know you, please turn their hearts towards you.

Lord bless my city and her people. 

> **1 Chronicles 29:18 O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.**

> **Acts 17:32 - 18:11 (CSB) When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to ridicule him, but others said, “We’d like to hear from you again about this.” So Paul left their presence. However, some people joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.**

> **After this, he left Athens and went to Corinth, where he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul came to them, and since they were of the same occupation, tentmakers by trade, he stayed with them and worked. He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.**

> **When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself to preaching the word and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. When they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his clothes and told them, “Your blood is on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole household. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.**

> **The Lord said to Paul in a night vision, “Don’t be afraid, but keep on speaking and don’t be silent. For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I have many people in this city.” He stayed there a year and a half, teaching the word of God among them.**
