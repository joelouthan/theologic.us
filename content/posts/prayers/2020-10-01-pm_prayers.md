> **2 Timothy 4:1-5 (CSB) I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.**

**Isaiah 61 (CSB)**

**The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me,**

**because the LORD has anointed me**

**to bring good news to the poor.**

**He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,**

**to proclaim liberty to the captives**

**and freedom to the prisoners;**

**to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,**

**and the day of our God’s vengeance;**

**to comfort all who mourn,**

**to provide for those who mourn in Zion;**

**to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,**

**festive oil instead of mourning,**

**and splendid clothes instead of despair.**

**And they will be called righteous trees,**

**planted by the LORD**

**to glorify him.**



**They will rebuild the ancient ruins;**

**they will restore the former devastations;**

**they will renew the ruined cities,**

**the devastations of many generations.**



**Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,**

**and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.**



**But you will be called the LORD’s priests;**

**they will speak of you as ministers of our God;**

**you will eat the wealth of the nations,**

**and you will boast in their riches.**



**In place of your shame, you will have a double portion;**

**in place of disgrace, they will rejoice over their share.**



**So they will possess double in their land,**

**and eternal joy will be theirs.**



**For I the LORD love justice;**

**I hate robbery and injustice;**

**I will faithfully reward my people**

**and make a permanent covenant with them.**



**Their descendants will be known among the nations,**

**and their posterity among the peoples.**



**All who see them will recognize**

**that they are a people the LORD has blessed.**



**I rejoice greatly in the LORD,**

**I exult in my God;**

**for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation**

**and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness,**

**as a groom wears a turban**

**and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.**



**For as the earth produces its growth,**

**and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up,**

**so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise**

**to spring up before all the nations.**

# Prayers for the church as a whole

1\. **Backbone of steel**

> **John 10:11-18 (CSB) “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand, since he is not the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, leaves them and runs away when he sees a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches and scatters them. This happens because he is a hired hand and doesn’t care about the sheep.**

> **“I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”**

2\. **Chaff to be separated**

> **Matthew 3:12 (CSB) His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn. But the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out.”**

3\. **More harvesters** 

> **Matthew 9:35-38 (CSB) Jesus continued going around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness. When he saw the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”**

Lord, every second of every day I must ask you: what is mine to do. I confess and repent that I don't turn to you. Lord, be gracious to me.

My God, give me your Spirit. Give me the fullness of the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Moreso than for me to preach your word but to turn my heart and cleanse my heart and make me just like you. 

Draw me closer. Let the world die to me so I can live to you.


## Leaders within Frontline

Lord, would you raise up even more leaders for Norman. No matter what direction we take please tap more leaders.  More musicians. More of your Son in each of us so it won’t be dependent on any of us but on you alone.  

Lord, be glorified in our homes and in our city. Today.
