# Pray to preach the gospel

> **2 Timothy 4:1-5 (ESV) I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.**

Lord,

Deliver them. Protect them. Keep them.

## Leaders within Frontline

Lord, would you raise up even more leaders for Norman. No matter what direction we take please tap more leaders.  More musicians. More of your Son in each of us so it won’t be dependent on any of us but on you alone.  

Lord, be glorified in our homes and in our city. Today.

# Frontline Norman

Lord,

I believe I have your vision. I do not desire a ministry. My only desire is to faithfully handle your precious word and preach the gospel of Christ and him crucified.

But not my will but your will be done.

Amen.
