## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 41:1–20 
      Listen to me in silence, O coastlands; 
      let the peoples renew their strength; 
      let them approach, then let them speak; 
      let us together draw near for judgment. 

      Who stirred up one from the east 
      whom victory meets at every step? 
      He gives up nations before him, 
      so that he tramples kings underfoot; 
      he makes them like dust with his sword, 
      like driven stubble with his bow. 
      He pursues them and passes on safely, 
      by paths his feet have not trod. 
      Who has performed and done this, 
      calling the generations from the beginning? 
      I, the LORD, the first, 
      and with the last; I am he. 
    
      The coastlands have seen and are afraid; 
      the ends of the earth tremble; 
      they have drawn near and come. 
      Everyone helps his neighbor 
      and says to his brother, “Be strong!” 
      The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith, 
      and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, 
      saying of the soldering, “It is good”; 
      and they strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved. 
    
      But you, Israel, my servant, 
      Jacob, whom I have chosen, 
      the offspring of Abraham, my friend; 
      you whom I took from the ends of the earth, 
      and called from its farthest corners, 
      saying to you, “You are my servant, 
      I have chosen you and not cast you off”; 
      fear not, for I am with you; 
      be not dismayed, for I am your God; 
      I will strengthen you, I will help you, 
      I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. 
    
      Behold, all who are incensed against you 
      shall be put to shame and confounded; 
      those who strive against you 
      shall be as nothing and shall perish. 
      You shall seek those who contend with you, 
      but you shall not find them; 
      those who war against you 
      shall be as nothing at all. 
      For I, the LORD your God, 
      hold your right hand; 
      it is I who say to you, “Fear not, 
      I am the one who helps you.” 
    
      Fear not, you worm Jacob, 
      you men of Israel! 
      I am the one who helps you, declares the LORD; 
      your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 
      Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge, 
      new, sharp, and having teeth; 
      you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, 
      and you shall make the hills like chaff; 
      you shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, 
      and the tempest shall scatter them. 
      And you shall rejoice in the LORD; 
      in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory. 
    
      When the poor and needy seek water, 
      and there is none, 
      and their tongue is parched with thirst, 
      I the LORD will answer them; 
      I the God of Israel will not forsake them. 
      I will open rivers on the bare heights, 
      and fountains in the midst of the valleys. 
      I will make the wilderness a pool of water, 
      and the dry land springs of water. 
      I will put in the wilderness the cedar, 
      the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive. 
      I will set in the desert the cypress, 
      the plane and the pine together, 
      that they may see and know, 
      may consider and understand together, 
      that the hand of the LORD has done this, 
      the Holy One of Israel has created it.

My Lord and my God,

Who is like you who have created the heavens and the earth.

Who is like you who created a creature like me, in your image?

But who is like you when we rebel and fight against you, yet in your tenderness and mercy bring me back from the dead again and again.

You are alone are worthy of worship.

Praise your holy name.

### Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
