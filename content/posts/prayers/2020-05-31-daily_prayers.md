## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

God,

I am so happy and yet so sleepy. I am so scared that I will revert back to my old self. I can't keep my head on straight. Please help me in this. 

I can't even celebrate Pentecost. But this day marks the day that you clearly lead us to Frontline. For that, I'm forever grateful.

I am distraught by the events in America at the moment. But I know I will pray that you will show up and put your glory on display. Save us all. You are not weak. Your arms are not short. Save us.

Secure me and give me peace. I need you now more than ever. Amen.

**Sarah, my love** - Thank you for your sweet work in her. Thank you

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - I see your work in me. Please don't stop.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - Thank you for this.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - Thank you for your grace so that my life would be counted for something actually worthwhile. 

**For my Jonathan** - Thank you.

### Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
