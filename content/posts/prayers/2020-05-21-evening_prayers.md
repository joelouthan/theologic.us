### For those who do not know You

Lord,

I bless you and your righteous name. There is none like you. I give you praise for you are my holiness and goodness alone.

My Lord, I pray for all of these. Will you save them? Save your elect and then elect some more? I cannot beg nor plead because I cannot convince them unless you swap their hearts with yours and you give them your Spirit. I pray that they will always be your people and you shall be there God.

Help them to turn to you. Soften their hearts.
