## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

My Lord,

You are my love and my joy forever. You alone have been my steadfast love and kindness. Your mercies have never come to end.

I thank you for your faithfulness to me. Blessed be your holy name forever.

**Sarah, my love** - Thank you for the growth and love that you have given her. She has grown so much in this time and the Spirit within her has gotten stronger. Do your will.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - I beg you. Please give this to me.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - You are the one who gave me this desire and I don't know what to do with it. I keep feeling like I am doing something wrong or not doing something right. But I am your child, predestined to your glory. Continue your grace in me, O my Lord and God.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. â€”Henry Martyn** - I know this to be true. My life is yours. Whatever you see fit, have your will in me. Whatever it takes. Amen.
