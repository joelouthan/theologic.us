## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 43:8-13
Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes,
who are deaf, yet have ears!
All the nations gather together,
and the peoples assemble.
Who among them can declare this,
and show us the former things?
Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right,
and let them hear and say, It is true.
“You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD,
“and my servant whom I have chosen,
that you may know and believe me
and understand that I am he.
Before me no god was formed,
nor shall there be any after me.
I, I am the LORD,
and besides me there is no savior.
I declared and saved and proclaimed,
when there was no strange god among you;
and you are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and I am God.
Also henceforth I am he;
there is none who can deliver from my hand;
I work, and who can turn it back?”
</pre>

My God, 

You alone are my savior and redeemer. There is none like you. I am completely dependent upon you for my life. 

Do not let me turn from you. Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Do not let my heart wander from you. 

Call me every second of my life. 

I will worship you. 

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

Please deliver these people to you.  

**Sarah, my love** Lord, please show her there is no expectation from me. None like what she has gone through.  Please show her that it is enough for her to be here with me. 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** thank you over and over again. I can hear myself and I can apologize and repent in the moment.  You are doing this. Your spirit guides me. Be glorified. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** a little grace.  A lot of provision. All of your words. 

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** I praise you for my life and every single thing I have been through.  Redeem it all. Save your people. 

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ** please keep doing what you are doing in my life 

**For my Jonathan** lord I thank you for the relationships i already have been blessed with.  Continue to grow us. 

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.**

Lord what it is I thank you. I do fear it is going to come up in weird or unhealthy ways.  But You lead me. Be my vision. 

## Next steps

- *Elder at Frontline*
- *Internship at Frontline*
- *Management at Red Hat*

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

God i don’t know what you want me to do or called me to do.  I’m still sorting that out. But you have given me so much grace. Thank you for where you gave me now. 

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
