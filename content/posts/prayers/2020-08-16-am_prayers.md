## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>

</b></pre>



## Foremost

Heal Amber. Lord, please heal her. Moreso, turn her heart towards you in this moment. Save and protect Kara. Protect my babies. Protect Eli & Ivy.Protect their sibs: Griffen, Gabe, Emma, Lucy, Grace, and Leslie. Save their home, Lord.

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

Heal Reva & Ronnie. 

Heal and be with Emily and the baby. Lord, let this not be a difficult pregnancy. But we have put our hope and trust into you alone, the only one who gives life.

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.  

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

I thank you and praise you for healing Natasha's body. But God, please heal her soul and her little heart. You alone comfort us and give us your peace. Let your Spirit fall upon Aaron, Natasha, and Audrey.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**

Lord, every second of every day I must ask you: what is mine to do. I confess and repent that I don't turn to you. Lord, be gracious to me.

My God, give me your Spirit. Give me the fullness of the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Moreso than for me to preach your word but to turn my heart and cleanse my heart and make me just like you. 

Draw me closer. Let the world die to me so I can live to you.
