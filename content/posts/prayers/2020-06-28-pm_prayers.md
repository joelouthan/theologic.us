## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 45:11-13
Thus says the LORD,
the Holy One of Israel, and the one who formed him:
“Ask me of things to come;
will you command me concerning my children and the work of my hands?
I made the earth
and created man on it;
it was my hands that stretched out the heavens,
and I commanded all their host.
I have stirred him up in righteousness,
and I will make all his ways level;
he shall build my city
and set my exiles free,
not for price or reward,”
says the LORD of hosts.
</pre>

Lord, 

Keep me righteous before you

Capture my heart and turn it towards you

Change my mind and let my my thoughts be capture unto Christ 

Be thou my vision 

Be my love. 

Do not let your Spirit depart from me.  More so, give me double portion.  Because I will need you so desperately. 

Like I need you now. 

Lord please provide for me a new job so I can respond to your call. Just be my provision 

I love you Lord
You alone are good
Hope that once was lost
Now stands renewed
