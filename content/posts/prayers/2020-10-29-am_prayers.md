# Pray to preach the gospel

> **2 Timothy 4:1-5 (ESV) I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.**

# For healing

My Lord,

I pray for that you would heal:

Heal Faithie. My Lord above, heal my sweet cousin. Comfort her and speak peace. Lay your hand upon her head and continuously give her peace forever. Take care of her and give her body and mind and nervous system healing always. Hold her together with your hands and heart.

Heal Sean. Vertigo double focus. Lord heal his mind and body. Give him rest and peace. Lord show him the love you have for him.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

Heal Randy (Jordan Mayfield's dad) - possible hospice

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

# Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**

# Next steps

My God,

I am so uncertain. What are my next steps? Direct me, Holy Spirit.

But I will praise you for the triple blessings of being with the staff. Bless them and keep them always.

Amen

# For those who do not know You

My Lord above,

Call on me. I will be obedient. Tell me with whom shall I share your good news: you are Jesus and you have saved his people from their sins. If they believe and trust in you, they will live.
