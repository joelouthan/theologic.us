## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 44:23
Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it;
shout, O depths of the earth;
break forth into singing, O mountains,
O forest, and every tree in it!
For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,
and will be glorified in Israel.
</pre>

My Precious Lord,

All of this that you have provided for me for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.

You are the very breath in my lungs and the king of my heart. You are the fire in my soul and the spark in my mind. You are the Spirit inside of me.

Lord, I don’t have the right words to express all of my heart and life. I ask just this one thing: do not let your Spirit depart from me and let me dwell in your presence all the days of my life. 

Heal Natasha. Bless her in this time. Let peace fall on the Gayles. Be with Aaron and Audrey.

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

**Sarah, my love** Lord, keep shaping her heart and renewing her mind. I thank you and bless you for your mighty work in her. Amen!

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** I seent it! I have seen your work in me. MAKE ME JUST LIKE YOU!

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** More grace is needed. Double the amount, like you did for Elisha and John the Baptist.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** I praise you for all of my pain, hardships, broken hearts, for all the hurt, and the tears, and the crying anguish and screams and yells, and arguments and the rape and the molestation and my own foolishness or my own sins and my own hurts and my own temptations and falling from grace and everything...

... if I could bear witness about the Light. If you save one other person. If you save millions of others. It is already all worth it.

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

**For my Jonathan** 

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.**

**As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.

Your provision is *absolutely* perfect. I thank you and praise you.



## Next steps

- *Elder at Frontline*
- *Internship at Frontline*
- *Management at Red Hat*
- *Student at OU*

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
