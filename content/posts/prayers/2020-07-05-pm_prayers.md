## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 47:8-9
Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures,
who sit securely,
who say in your heart,
“I am, and there is no one besides me;
I shall not sit as a widow
or know the loss of children”:
These two things shall come to you
in a moment, in one day;
the loss of children and widowhood
shall come upon you in full measure,
in spite of your many sorceries
and the great power of your enchantments.
</pre>

My God,

I have relinquished all control except for self control and handed it over to you. 

I continue to learn that I cannot control anybody except myself. 

Keep your spirit within me and draw me closer to you. 

Amen.
