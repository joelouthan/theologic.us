## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 32:12–20
  Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, 
      for the fruitful vine, 
      for the soil of my people 
      growing up in thorns and briers, 
      yes, for all the joyous houses 
      in the exultant city. 
      For the palace is forsaken, 
      the populous city deserted; 
      the hill and the watchtower 
      will become dens forever, 
      a joy of wild donkeys, 
      a pasture of flocks; 
      until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, 
      and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, 
      and the fruitful field is deemed a forest. 
      Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, 
      and righteousness abide in the fruitful field. 
      And the effect of righteousness will be peace, 
      and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever. 
      My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, 
      in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. 
      And it will hail when the forest falls down, 
      and the city will be utterly laid low. 
      Happy are you who sow beside all waters, 
      who let the feet of the ox and the donkey range free.
</pre>

My God,

I pray that you will save me and the people in my life from complacency. What have we done that can compare to your mighty works? What can I do to rescue me from Sheol and the bowels of sin? What I can I do but protect myself from the fiery arrows of Satan and his demons?

No! Christ the champion and the king of kings. Christ is the one who has put demons and death to open shame by sacrificing himself in perfection and holiness upon that cross to win and save his people perfectly and wonderfully once for all time forever.

I love you Lord. I pray that Christ would be the king of my life and heart and soul forever. Save us.

<pre>
  Isaiah 32:1–8
  Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, 
      and princes will rule in justice. 
      Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, 
      a shelter from the storm, 
      like streams of water in a dry place, 
      like the shade of a great rock in a weary land. 
      Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, 
      and the ears of those who hear will give attention. 
      The heart of the hasty will understand and know, 
      and the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak distinctly. 
      The fool will no more be called noble, 
      nor the scoundrel said to be honorable. 
      For the fool speaks folly, 
      and his heart is busy with iniquity, 
      to practice ungodliness, 
      to utter error concerning the LORD, 
      to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, 
      and to deprive the thirsty of drink. 
      As for the scoundrel—his devices are evil; 
      he plans wicked schemes 
      to ruin the poor with lying words, 
      even when the plea of the needy is right. 
      But he who is noble plans noble things, 
      and on noble things he stands.

**Sarah, my love** - I praise you for the real work you are doing in her. I see where once fear reign, you and your love reign in here. Be magnified in her soul and heart today.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - I am praying on the promises of your word. I can change because your word says You will change me and make me look like your son. Do you work in me now, O Lord, and draw me closer to you. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - Just grace. Just grace to do your will for the rest of my days. But I will praise you for what you have done in me and for me thus far.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - Thank you for my life of suffering and of compromise. But use my life to point to Christ and save my entire city.

**For my Jonathan** - Your provision alone. Only you can cross our paths. Praise be your holy name.
