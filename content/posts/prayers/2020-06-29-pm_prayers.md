## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 45:15-17
Truly, you are a God who hides himself,
O God of Israel, the Savior.
All of them are put to shame and confounded;
the makers of idols go in confusion together.
But Israel is saved by the LORD
with everlasting salvation;
you shall not be put to shame or confounded
to all eternity.
</pre>

I have spent all of my life confused and in shame. 

But you are my rescuer and my deliverer. My God in whom do I trust. 

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and who is and who is to come. 

Blessed be the Lord God almighty who reigns forevermore. 

Who reigns forevermore.
