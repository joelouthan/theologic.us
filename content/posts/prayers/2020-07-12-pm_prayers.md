## Acts 20:22–27 (ESV) And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,  except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.  But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.  And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.  Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all,  for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.

<pre><b>
Isaiah 49:1-4
The Servant of the LORD
Listen to me, O coastlands,
and give attention, you peoples from afar.
The LORD called me from the womb,
from the body of my mother he named my name.
He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
he made me a polished arrow;
in his quiver he hid me away.
And he said to me, “You are my servant,
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
But I said, “I have labored in vain;
I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
yet surely my right is with the LORD,
and my recompense with my God.”
</b></pre>

My God!

These are my words and my plea. This is my prayer and my testimony. 

I have wasted my days away.  Rejecting you.  Disobeying you. Sinning against you. 

But you were my Lord from birth. Called me to do your will. 

I shall be your servant until the day I die. 

I shall be your polished arrow. Your sharpened dagger. Your sharp sword. 

Where you go I will follow. I live and die by your will. And I am brought into glory by your Son.  

Give me words and I will speak and no more. What is mine to do? 

I love you.  With everything within me I will praise your holy name forever.  Amen.
