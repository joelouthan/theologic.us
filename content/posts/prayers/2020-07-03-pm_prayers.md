## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 46:8-11
“Remember this and stand firm,
recall it to mind, you transgressors,
remember the former things of old;
for I am God, and there is no other;
I am God, and there is none like me,
declaring the end from the beginning
and from ancient times things not yet done,
saying, My counsel shall stand,
and I will accomplish all my purpose,’
calling a bird of prey from the east,
the man of my counsel from a far country.
I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;
I have purposed, and I will do it.
</pre>

Lord,

You said we believe and trust in you that:

- You would not abandoned us to hell
- You would not let us see corruption
- We will be lead by the Spirit to the fully and truly alive
- We will have fullness of joy
- We will have pleasures forevermore 
- We will be fully satisfied 
- We will look like your son

Lord I ask for these things now.  Draw me close. Do your will. Keep me from sin. Cleansed my heart. Make me like you. 

Amen.
