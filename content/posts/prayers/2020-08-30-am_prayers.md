## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>

</b></pre>



## Foremost

**Sarah & Melissa**
**Sarah & Steph**
**Sarah & Erin**
**Sarah & Faith**

Lord, 

      I give thanks to you, Almighty God. 
      There is none like you. 
      I worship you, O Prince of Peace, 
      that is what I long to do.
      I'll give you praise 
      for you alone are my righteousness.

I worship you, Almighty God. 
There is none like you.

You have answered my prayers time and time and time again.
I called on you. And you answered. And you came to their rescue. 

You are my wonderful God in heaven.

My Lord,

I pray for that you would heal:

Sam Im - that Christ would be magnified in his heart and soul and home and family and work and life!

Heal Kim Feighner - Lord, you are her healer and strength. But God, she trembles in fear with sleep. I pray that you give her you unmatched and quite frankly, unknown and unexperienced peace that we cannot know in the natural but can only come by you--for you are holy and righteous and infinitely far from sin. You alone are good. Be her Comfort. Give her the fullness of your Spirit. Lord, that she may worship you all of her days.

Heal Randy (Jordan Mayfield's dad) - medical complications and lots of attention; praying for healing and peace

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

Heal and be with Emily and the baby. Lord, let this not be a difficult pregnancy. But we have put our hope and trust into you alone, the only one who gives life.

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.  

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

Lord God Almighty,

Who was, and is, and is to come,

Please bring Christ-exalting, cross-prophesying, blood covered, Spirit-filled, God glorifying, deep friendships to my sweetest Sarah. Until then, equip me to be God-worthy friend. Show me how I can lift her up and point her to your Son.

In our lives and in our friendship, relationship, and marriage, Lord, be glorified today.

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**


## Next steps

My God,

What have you done for me?

I will thank you and praise you!

Intern at the church you have sent me to and the one I love.

A heart for people of Norman. Lord, GIVE ME MORE NAMES! So I can lift them up to you.

Adjunct at Moore Norman Tech. This was completely and literally uncalled for.

Possibility of senior tech writer with Red Hat? Who would have thought? Not in a million years.

You know what you have provided. I cannot connect all the dots but I know you have always been my provision.

What else? I don't even know. But you are my God and Lord.

But Lord, all of this is good. But how do I point others towards you? Give me gifts so you can turn other hearts towards you.

All of this means nothing if it is not for your glory.

Lord, I pray that you have many many people here in this city. Call on me to preach and minister your Word to them.

Amen.

## Discipleship Group

Lord,

There is war outside no man is ever safe from. There is an full assault on your sons and daughters. Satan and his demons and the world is waging against us and it is all out.

God, you shall protect us because you are our shield.

But Lord, just like the mighty men of David, we are here to fight our sin and choke it with our bare hands until it dies.

We need your salvation. You have to cover us with your righteousness. Give us the call the strap our feet with the gospel of your peace. We need the gift of faith. We need your word.

Magnify and glorify Christ in us. 

Shatter the gates of hell.

I love you so much.

Daniel 2:19-23 (CSB) The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of the heavens and declared:

      May the name of God
      be praised forever and ever,
      for wisdom and power belong to him.
      He changes the times and seasons;
      he removes kings and establishes kings.
      He gives wisdom to the wise
      and knowledge to those
      who have understanding.
      He reveals the deep and hidden things;
      he knows what is in the darkness,
      and light dwells with him.
      I offer thanks and praise to you,
      God of my ancestors,
      because you have given me
      wisdom and power.
      And now you have let me know
      what we asked of you,
      for you have let us know
      the king’s mystery.
