## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>
2 Chronicles 10:10–11 (ESV) And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s thighs. 11 And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’ ”

Matthew 23:13–15 (ESV) “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.

*Lord, you have taught me what your church is. But I do not know how to fight against NAR.*

*They are crushing your people. Every leader that comes along, they strike your people with scorpions instead of whips?*

*But I know that the Messiah who took lashes on his back so that we never have to take lashes of legalism upon our back.*

*Christ fulfilled the law! Now we get to worship You in spirit and in truth.*

*Tell me how to loosen their shackles. Tell me how to direct them to the shadow of the Almighty.*
