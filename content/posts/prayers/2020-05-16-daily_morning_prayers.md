## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

You, O Lord, are high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all other gods.

I will exalt you, O Lord.

**Sarah, my love** - Give her blessings and grace.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Please do your work.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** -Please give me grace.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. â€”Henry Martyn** - Please redeem my life.

**For my Jonathan** - Please give me friends. Amen.
