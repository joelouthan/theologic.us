## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 41:21–24
      Set forth your case, says the LORD; 
      bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob. 
      Let them bring them, and tell us 
      what is to happen. 
      Tell us the former things, what they are, 
      that we may consider them, 
      that we may know their outcome; 
      or declare to us the things to come. 
      Tell us what is to come hereafter, 
      that we may know that you are gods; 
      do good, or do harm, 
      that we may be dismayed and terrified. 
      Behold, you are nothing, 
      and your work is less than nothing; 
      an abomination is he who chooses you.
</pre>

My God,

I repent of all of my idols of comforts and power.

I repent of all the things that I do to make me safe.

Help my unbelief. Save me from my sin.

Comfort me in your arms.

Cleanse me from all unrighteousness.

Help me trust in you. today.

**Sarah, my love** - thank you for her sweetness and kindness; generosity and wisdom; compassion and mercy. Thank you for the grace you have given her so that she has given to me.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Thank you for making me quicker when I am harsh. Lord, help me to be tender like you. I don't want to be hard. I want to be soft.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - If only.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - All of my life and suffering was worth it--because I get to point others to you.

**For my Jonathan** - Thank you for Andrew. Thank you for Dave. Thank you!

My Lord, again I do not know. Your scripture declares I do not know the beginning from the end. But you do. And I want to be in your will and do as you will. Your plans are better. Your ways are higher. I am limited and weak. You are mighty and all-knowing.  

Whatever maxes out your glory, that is what I am here for.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

You see, I don't know. I think I am called but what of that. What is your will in my life and in my family and in my church. Keep me aligned with what you want--nothing more.

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
