### For those who do not know You

I want to lift up every single person here even if I think they are saved. Truth is, I don't know. But you do. You know exactly where their hearts are at. Please draw their hearts into your presence and keep them there.

Till the soil. Choke the vines. Kill the birds. Shield the sun. Give water. Give the growth. Do not let one single person perish. I pray that you keep them.
