## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Psalm 40:1–4
      I waited patiently for the LORD; 
      he inclined to me and heard my cry. 
      He drew me up from the pit of destruction, 
      out of the miry bog, 
      and set my feet upon a rock, 
      making my steps secure. 
      He put a new song in my mouth, 
      a song of praise to our God. 
      Many will see and fear, 
      and put their trust in the LORD. 

      Blessed is the man who makes 
      the LORD his trust, 
      who does not turn to the proud, 
      to those who go astray after a lie!
</pre>



**Sarah, my love** - Bless her and keep her today. Strengthen our bonds and draw us closer to you.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Lord I ask for your will to be done in me. I need you now more than even. Renew my mind and give me a new heart. Fill me with your Spirit.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** -God, I ask for just so much grace to do your will. 

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - But thank you for this life that you have given me--so that I can glorify you with all of my heart.

**For my Jonathan** - You have answered once and you will answer again. Blessed be your holy name forever.

Amen.
