<pre>
  Isaiah 33:22–24
      For the LORD is our judge; the LORD is our lawgiver; 
      the LORD is our king; he will save us. 

      Your cords hang loose; 
      they cannot hold the mast firm in its place 
      or keep the sail spread out. 
      Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; 
      even the lame will take the prey. 
      And no inhabitant will say, “I am sick”; 
      the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
      </pre>
My Lord,

I am reminded as I was once in traitorous sin against you. The only one who has loved me and rescued me a thousand times.

Save me once more. Do not let me be deceived in thinking I can save myself and spare me from succumbing to temptation of running to my self-made idols that only served to crush and condemn me.

Your Son has rescued me. 

Your Spirit fills every crevice of my soul.

You are the Father who has given me your heart. 

And now I praise you always. Amen. 

### For those who do not know You
