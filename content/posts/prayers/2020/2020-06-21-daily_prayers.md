## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 43:22-28
“Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;
but you have been weary of me, O Israel!
You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings,
or honored me with your sacrifices.
I have not burdened you with offerings,
or wearied you with frankincense.
You have not bought me sweet cane with money,
or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
But you have burdened me with your sins;
you have wearied me with your iniquities.
“I, I am he
who blots out your transgressions for my own sake,
and I will not remember your sins.
Put me in remembrance; let us argue together;
set forth your case, that you may be proved right.
Your first father sinned,
and your mediators transgressed against me.
Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary,
and deliver Jacob to utter destruction
and Israel to reviling.
</pre>

My God,

You were right. The set your Son to destruction by pouring your wrath upon him so that you would blot out my transgressions against you. 

You are my Lord and my God. You never abandoned me to the Sheol. You did not leave me in Hades. You did not let me see corruption. 

You’ve rescued me. You redeemed me. You delivered me. All because you loved me to the utmost. 

Whatever you would have for me, be thou my vision, o my Father. Forever. 

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

**Sarah, my love** Lord, continue your work in her. I don’t know what you are doing but I see it and bear witness and it is good. Thank you. 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** how awesome is your name in all of the earth. Thank you for bringing me here. Do your will in me. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** always grace and power I ask for. I will not stop because i cannot do this without you. 

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** i don’t even know how that can be. I used to know. So take my life and lead others to your Son. 

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

Both His glory and the dimming of the world is sweetness to my soul 

**For my Jonathan** I cannot continue without him. But you have given me so many deep friendships and confidants. I will worship you and give you glory. 

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.**

Whatever I need you will provide. I’m not worried about this. You are my God.

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
