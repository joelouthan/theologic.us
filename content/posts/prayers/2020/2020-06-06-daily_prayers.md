## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 41:25–29
      I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, 
      from the rising of the sun, and he shall call upon my name; 
      he shall trample on rulers as on mortar, 
      as the potter treads clay. 
      26 Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know, 
      and beforehand, that we might say, “He is right”? 
      There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed, 
      none who heard your words. 
      27 I was the first to say to Zion, “Behold, here they are!” 
      and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news. 
      28 But when I look, there is no one; 
      among these there is no counselor 
      who, when I ask, gives an answer. 
      29 Behold, they are all a delusion; 
      their works are nothing; 
      their metal images are empty wind.
</pre>

My Lord,

I speak not as a preacher wanting to preach your word but rather as a sinner, saved by grace, wanting your word into my heart so that I will not sin against you.

My God, be my redemption. Let not Satan, sin, Death, demons and hell have the last word.  Let not the world think it has won.  Please spare my life. Please heal my heart. Please restore my soul for your name's sake.

**Sarah, my love** - She is the love of my life. I am throughly blessed in all ways because you have brought us together. Fervently and with great jealously, protect our marriage from **all** attacks.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - There are two paths are before me. More of me and more of you. I pick you.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - An ounce of your grace and all of your strength; the fullness of your Spirit and a brand new heart. Knees that bend and a soul that cries out, "Abba, Father". Please do this for me.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - With **all** of my days, I will thank you for this life because it points back to you.

Please, Lord, please help me get here before you take me home.

**For my Jonathan** - I thank you!

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?** My God, I really don't know. But I worship you, Almighty God, because there is none like you. I will give you praise for **you** are my righteousness.

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ

**Norman** 

We are asking for so much just to glance at your glory. But Lord, we have no one else to go to. We wholly trust in you alone. 

Only give us if this glorifies you. We want none of it if it doesn't. We are asking a supernatural and not lean on our understanding. No philosophy, no pragmatism, no will of man can do what you do.

Your Spirit must fall on us and the weight of your glory must be too much to bear--lest, we think we can do this on our own.

Beat that out of me. Your hand sanctifies me.
