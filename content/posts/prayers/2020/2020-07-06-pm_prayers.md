## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 48:1-2
Israel Refined for God's Glory
Hear this, O house of Jacob,
who are called by the name of Israel,
and who came from the waters of Judah,
who swear by the name of the LORD
and confess the God of Israel,
but not in truth or right.
For they call themselves after the holy city,
and stay themselves on the God of Israel;
the LORD of hosts is his name.
</pre>

My Lord,

Keep me within your precious city and within your grace. 

So I might dwell with you forever and never sin against you. 

You are the fortress and rock of my salvation. 

And I love you.
