## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 45:8
â€œShower, O heavens, from above,
and let the clouds rain down righteousness;
let the earth open, that salvation and righteousness may bear fruit;
let the earth cause them both to sprout;
I the LORD have created it.
</pre>

Lord,

It is your salvation and your righteousness in me.  I pray and ask that it will bear fruit in me.  

Lord everybody I know, save.  I seek your power and might.  Not in me but you to them.  You know best.  All I want is to witness your glory. 

Gosh what a beautiful day.  Thank you for giving my sweet family the best memory ever.  Thank you for the fish. Thank you for the turtle. Lord help us take care of your creature. 

Blessed be your name. 

Thank you for the food. 

I love you Lord. 

Thank you for everything.
