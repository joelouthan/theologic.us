## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

**Sarah, my love** - Look at your work in here. As she praises and worships you. Lord, please give us a child and we will be forever grateful to you.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Have your way in me. Whatever you need to do, do it. You are my God and my Lord forever.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - All I ask is grace. Lord, where shall I go? What is your direction? Lead me.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. â€”Henry Martyn** - Thank you for this life. Thank you for the sweetest redemption that I have ever known. Oh I have seen your grace and I give you thanks a million times over. You are God.

**For my *Jonathan*** - I need you to bring to me friends that are spiritual friends. Keep me from overlooking men who are already in my presence. But for the friends I do have, thank you.
