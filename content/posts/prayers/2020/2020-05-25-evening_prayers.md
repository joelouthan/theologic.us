  Isaiah 40:1–11
			Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. 
      Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, 
      and cry to her 
      that her warfare is ended, 
      that her iniquity is pardoned, 
      that she has received from the LORD’s hand 
      double for all her sins. 

      A voice cries: 
      “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; 
      make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
      Every valley shall be lifted up, 
      and every mountain and hill be made low; 
      the uneven ground shall become level, 
      and the rough places a plain. 
      And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, 
      and all flesh shall see it together, 
      for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.” 
    
      A voice says, “Cry!” 
      And I said, “What shall I cry?” 
      All flesh is grass, 
      and all its beauty is like the flower of the field. 
      The grass withers, the flower fades 
      when the breath of the LORD blows on it; 
      surely the people are grass. 
      The grass withers, the flower fades, 
      but the word of our God will stand forever. 
    
      Go on up to a high mountain, 
      O Zion, herald of good news; 
      lift up your voice with strength, 
      O Jerusalem, herald of good news; 
      lift it up, fear not; 
      say to the cities of Judah, 
      “Behold your God!” 
      Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, 
      and his arm rules for him; 
      behold, his reward is with him, 
      and his recompense before him. 
      He will tend his flock like a shepherd; 
      he will gather the lambs in his arms; 
      he will carry them in his bosom, 
      and gently lead those that are with young.

My God!

I believe with everything in my being that I believe. 

But I want to wander and stray away from you because I am tempted by what the world and sin and Satan and people give.

But you promised to gather me, to draw me near, to keep me in your presence.

My God, **do not let you Spirit depart from me!**

I bless your name, O Lord. I have seen and felt and know your work in me. I see that you rescued me from sin and you are good and gracious and giving and kind.

Give your mercy. But give me your strength. You have seen my weakness.

Rescue me from despair. Keep me close. Do not let me go.

I will worship you
Almighty God
There is none like you

I give you praise
For you are my righteousness.

I worship you
Almighty God
There is none like you

Amen.

### For those who do not know You

My God,

You are the Elector and the Caller.

You are the Justifier and the Glorifier.

Salvation belongs to you alone for you are the only one who can save.

So save this entire list of people.

Save your people! And elect some more!

### Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

My Lord, I deeply repent and strip all that is within me. I am sorry when I have waged war against your love. How you treat your Bride is the way I want to serve her. You make her glorious, clothing her in splendor and majesty. You wash her in the water of Your Word. Do you work. Have your way. Align me with what you do. Keep me in your will.
