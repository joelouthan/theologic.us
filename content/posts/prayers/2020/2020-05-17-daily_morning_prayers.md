## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Lamentations 3:22–24
      The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; 
      his mercies never come to an end; 
      they are new every morning; 
      great is your faithfulness. 
      “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, 
      “therefore I will hope in him.”</pre>

<pre>Psalm 73:21–26
      When my soul was embittered, 
      when I was pricked in heart, 
      I was brutish and ignorant; 
      I was like a beast toward you.

      Nevertheless, I am continually with you; 
      you hold my right hand. 
      You guide me with your counsel, 
      and afterward you will receive me to glory. 
      Whom have I in heaven but you? 
      And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. 
      My flesh and my heart may fail, 
      but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</pre>



My Lord,

Write your words upon my heart so that I will not sin against you, O Lord my Rock and Redeemer forever.

**Sarah, my love** - Bless her on this day. Thank you for the sweetest loves that you have given her. Give us a child on this day. 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Thank you for your work in me. Have you way.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - I need your strength, heart, grace, mercy, and Spirit in order to do this. Equip me. Raise me up. Speak into me. And speak for me. I cannot do this without you.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - If I needed to go through what I have been through so that I might win souls to you, oh it was so worth it. You are the prize and the goal. You are the beginning and the end. 

**For my Jonathan** -Thank you for what you are doing here when I cannot even see it.

Amen.
