## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 48:6–8 (ESV)

      “You have heard; now see all this; 
      and will you not declare it? 
      From this time forth I announce to you new things, 
      hidden things that you have not known. 
      7 They are created now, not long ago; 
      before today you have never heard of them, 
      lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’ 
      8 You have never heard, you have never known, 
      from of old your ear has not been opened. 
      For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, 
      and that from before birth you were called a rebel.
</pre>

My God,

You always knew that I was a sinner. I was born into sin and I sin continuously.

Everything that I have done to rebel against your holy name does not come as a shock or as a surprised.

But you did not cast me out into the sea. You did not abandoned my soul into hell. You did not let me die in corruption of my own sin.

You O Lord are my heart's desire and I long to worship you.

You have been perfectly faithful and loving and kind to me in every single way.

Lord, do not let your Spirit depart from me.

Keep me in your grace. Keep me from evil.

Keep my eyes on you.

Lord, I wait on you. You are my Lord and the Rock of my salvation forever. Amen.

## Foremost

Heal Natasha. Bless her in this time. Let peace fall on the Gayles. Be with Aaron and Audrey.

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** My Lord, keep having your way in her heart and mind. Give her all the grace to carry out your will. I praise you for leading her when I have been too blind and too heavy handed. You have given us both grace. I will praise your holy name.

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** Bless him and his family and his children and children’s children. Bless his entire family. Save them all to you.

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you**  Please don’t stop until I am just like you. My old self has past away. You are making me new.

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.** 

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**


## Next steps

- *Elder at Frontline*
- *Internship at Frontline*
- *Management at Red Hat*
- *Student at OU*

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen. 

Also, by no means do I think I am qualified and ready. When I was young in the faith, I thought I was ready and that I would be sustained by grace. But what I know is that I am not ready and I will always have to be sustained by grace. I trust in you that you have called me to do your will but you will give me the grace to do your will. You will give me your strength. You will give me the fullness of your Spirit. Why? Because you gave me your precious Son. And now you are mine and I am yours forever. Amen

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ

Six ways of doing greater things than Christ 

1. *Ministry of sight* - seeing the unseen. Who are you missing? Who are you ignoring? *Matthew 9:10-13
And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”*

2. *Ministry of touch* - moving towards. laying on of hands. Blessing. Do we avoid parts of town? Them vs they. 

3. *Ministry of suffering* - healing and suffering. Both. And God is enough. 

4. *Ministry of word and deed* - always Jesus

5. *Ministry of locality* Acts 17:24-5

6. *Ministry of warfare*

Lord, my heart grieves over NAR. I have seen their claws being dug into the hearts and minds of people I love. I don’t think it is coincidence that I have been in two of these churches and 90% of my friends *still* attend these churches. My Father, what would you have me to do? If this is not demonic and deceitful, then I repent with all of my heart for making a foolish judgment. But if you have lead me by your Spirit, then what I can I do. I would be more than glad to stand to the side and see your glory at work. But if you have asked me to do something, then I am always yours. Choose me. But give me your Spirit and your strength and your words and what to do. Because this task is too monumental. This is too much and I cannot bear the weight. I have tooo too many friends that I love and adore.

Pray for them? that I can do. Give me your grace Father. Tell me what I mine to do. Amen.
