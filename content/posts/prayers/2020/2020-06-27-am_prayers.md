## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 45:1-7
Cyrus, God's Instrument
Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus,
whose right hand I have grasped,
to subdue nations before him
and to loose the belts of kings,
to open doors before him
that gates may not be closed:
“I will go before you
and level the exalted places,
I will break in pieces the doors of bronze
and cut through the bars of iron,
I will give you the treasures of darkness
and the hoards in secret places,
that you may know that it is I, the LORD,
the God of Israel, who call you by your name.
For the sake of my servant Jacob,
and Israel my chosen,
I call you by your name,
I name you, though you do not know me.
I am the LORD, and there is no other,
besides me there is no God;
I equip you, though you do not know me,
that people may know, from the rising of the sun
and from the west, that there is none besides me;
I am the LORD, and there is no other.
I form light and create darkness;
I make well-being and create calamity;
I am the LORD, who does all these things.
</pre>
Lord,

I ask you to do these things in our nation because you are sovereignly good and wonderful.  But I ask you to do these things in me.  Do what you must so that I will always know you are God alone.

**Sarah, my love** Lord do your work in her. But bless her and us with a child.  We will dedicate the child to you. And she will never not know the love of God for her. And we will contend for you to save her. Because salvation belongs to you alone. 

Bless us Lord. Please give us a child. 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** i see this more and more.  Thank you. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** just your grace and the fullness of your Spirit

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** everyday i want to thank you for this life. Because I know and love you and you know and love me. 

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ** do your will

**For my Jonathan** I bless you King Jesus 

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.** it’s yours.  Do with it as you must.  

**As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me. amen

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
