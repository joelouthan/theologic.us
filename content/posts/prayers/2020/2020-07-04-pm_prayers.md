## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 47:1-4
The Humiliation of Babylon
Come down and sit in the dust,
O virgin daughter of Babylon;
sit on the ground without a throne,
O daughter of the Chaldeans!
For you shall no more be called
tender and delicate.
Take the millstones and grind flour,
put off your veil,
strip off your robe, uncover your legs,
pass through the rivers.
Your nakedness shall be uncovered,
and your disgrace shall be seen.
I will take vengeance,
and I will spare no one.
Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name—
is the Holy One of Israel.
</pre>

Lord 

Spare me from your wrath

Bring me in as your son.
