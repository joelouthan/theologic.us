## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 44:21–22
      Remember these things, O Jacob, 
      and Israel, for you are my servant; 
      I formed you; you are my servant; 
      O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me. 
      22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud 
      and your sins like mist; 
      return to me, for I have redeemed you.

</pre>

My Lord,

You have already done the work and there is nothing for me to do except always and forever run to you.

My God, I need your strength, knowledge, wisdom to accomplish this task. Please help me Lord. I want to step into your call but not without grace to do your will today. Today you have this for me. Lord help me today.

Heal Natasha. Bless her in this time. Let peace fall on the Gayles. Be with Aaron and Audrey.

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

**Sarah, my love** Thank you for the work you have in her.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** Lord, thank you for your work in me.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** Lord, thank you for your grace.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** Lord, thank you for preserving my life unto you.

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ** Lord, thank you for letting me bear witness to your glory.

**For my Jonathan** Lord, thank you for my friends and for you being my friend.

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.** Lord, thank you for my redemption.

**As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”** Lord, thank you for calling me to ministry.

Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.

Thank you for being my all in all.

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
