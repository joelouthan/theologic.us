## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 40:27–31

      27 Why do you say, O Jacob, 
      and speak, O Israel, 
      “My way is hidden from the LORD, 
      and my right is disregarded by my God”? 
      28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? 
      The LORD is the everlasting God, 
      the Creator of the ends of the earth. 
      He does not faint or grow weary; 
      his understanding is unsearchable. 
      29 He gives power to the faint, 
      and to him who has no might he increases strength. 
      30 Even youths shall faint and be weary, 
      and young men shall fall exhausted; 
      31 but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; 
      they shall mount up with wings like eagles; 
      they shall run and not be weary; 
      they shall walk and not faint.

</pre>

My God,

I might be older but in so many ways, I am young.

Young in spirit, faith, and in hope.

I was once strong, so I thought. But the constant persecution and weakening humbled me and made me see that I am so very weak--even at my strongest.

My Lord God, my flesh and heart *did* fail. I can only imagine I will fail several hundred times more. But you are the strength of my heart and my portion forevermore.

Yes, even I was a beast before you.

You are still the Lord my God.

And I will always love you.

**Sarah, my love** - Give her your heart and then new desires. Don't lose her. Keep her close for your name sake. Renew in her your strength, spirit, and love. Keep her. My God keep her.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Please have your way in me. More and more I don't care what it looks like so long as your Spirit **never** departs from me.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - But I ask for grace for this: preach and proclaim your word. To one or millions, it matters not. So long as you are glorified, that is all that matters. But right now it is easy to say that. So keep me focused upon you. I don't want to be a lesson to the masses.  Christ is the lesson. Christ is the atonement. Christ is the Savior of the world. I don't want to draw attention to myself. My ego would go uncheck and I will fall away from you. I have lived too long without you and I don't want to spend one day without you. You are my love song. You are the joy of my heart.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - All of my sufferings, pain, and heartache glorify you. Because you are alone are the love that heals all.

**For my Jonathan** - My God, move in my life. Thank you that I can be the David or the Jonathan or the combination thereof.  Equip me and fill me with your spirit so that I can be just as much of a blessing as they will be to me. Amen.

### Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ

My Lord,

These is intense. But it is so good. I see your hand. And I cheer and praise your holy name.

But please give us a congregation in Norman. Lord, that we might be a people that is filled and lead by your Spirit and that we know the word and we yearn after your presence. But Lord, how do we minister in Norman? I don't want to be presumptuous in thinking I know how. Lord, if you desire, I will attend school here only to make me a better minister here. I'll do whatever you want. But I need your grace and grace alone to do it.

Amen.
