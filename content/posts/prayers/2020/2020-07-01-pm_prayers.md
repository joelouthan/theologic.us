## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 45:22-23
“Turn to me and be saved,
all the ends of the earth!
For I am God, and there is no other.
By myself I have sworn;
from my mouth has gone out in righteousness
a word that shall not return:
To me every knee shall bow,
every tongue shall swear allegiance.’
</pre>

Amen and amen.
