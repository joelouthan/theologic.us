## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>
Isaiah 49:13 (ESV)
      Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; 
      break forth, O mountains, into singing! 
      For the LORD has comforted his people 
      and will have compassion on his afflicted.
</b></pre>

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
who was and is and is to come

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
who reigns forevermore.

## Foremost

Heal and protect Emily and her baby. Be with the Robersons. Lord, give them peace and joy. 

Heal Natasha. Bless her in this time. Let peace fall on the Gayles. Be with Aaron and Audrey.

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.

Lord, these are scary times. And we need you because you are the only one who heals. Blessed be your glorious name.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** Thank you for this sweetest marriage. Thank you for the sweetness that is Sarah. Thank you that she challenges me and she loves me. Thank you for making her perfect for me.

Lord, how do we minister together and not separate? Give us one Spirit and unite us in that front. We love you Lord and we praise you. We adore you. Glorify your name in all the earth.

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**

I have seen your hand upon my life.

Lord, please, if it be your will and provision, allow me to switch jobs.

But if I need to be here longer, I will do so with joy and gladness. Because whatever you have given me is perfect and a blessing.

I love you Lord. Forever I willl love you.
