## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 42:1–4
      Behold my servant, whom I uphold, 
      my chosen, in whom my soul delights; 
      I have put my Spirit upon him; 
      he will bring forth justice to the nations. 
      2 He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, 
      or make it heard in the street; 
      3 a bruised reed he will not break, 
      and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; 
      he will faithfully bring forth justice. 
      4 He will not grow faint or be discouraged 
      till he has established justice in the earth; 
      and the coastlands wait for his law.

</pre>

My Lord God,

You have sent your Son to live and die for me. But in your glory, He rose from the dead and now he is ascended to your right hand forevermore.

I believe in your Son, Jesus Christ. I believed because he died, I am *fully alive*. 

And because of who He is, he has sent His Spirit to dwell and live in me.

Lord, continue to conform me to the image of your Son, the firstborn among many brothers.

Thank you for this precious time. Lord, I just want to be where you are.

Be glorified in my life and in my work and in my home.



**Sarah, my love** Thank you for her patience and kindness. Thank you for equipping her and creating her to be completely different. Thank you that she can take the heaviness of the heart and give it back to your Son. Lord, bless her today and keep her close.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Lord, keep your hand upon my heart.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - This one thing. Grace for this.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.”** ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ

Keep chipping away, Lord. Let me see your precious glory.

**For my Jonathan** I praise you for the relationships that I have.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
