## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 46:1-4
The Idols of Babylon and the One True God
Bel bows down; Nebo stoops;
their idols are on beasts and livestock;
these things you carry are borne
as burdens on weary beasts.
They stoop; they bow down together;
they cannot save the burden,
but themselves go into captivity.
“Listen to me, O house of Jacob,
all the remnant of the house of Israel,
who have been borne by me from before your birth,
carried from the womb;
even to your old age I am he,
and to gray hairs I will carry you.
I have made, and I will bear;
I will carry and will save.
</pre>

My God,

You have been my God since i was in my mother’s womb and even when I nursed at her breasts. 

When I was being hurt by my dad, abandoned by my mom, neglected by my stepmom and left to hell from my grandma, you were my God. 

From everlasting to everlasting, you are my God alone. 

And i love you. Oh how i love you.  You are the one that my heart adores. 

I will praise you till i die. 

Amen.
