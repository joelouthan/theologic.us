## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 42:5–9
      Thus says God, the LORD, 
      who created the heavens and stretched them out, 
      who spread out the earth and what comes from it, 
      who gives breath to the people on it 
      and spirit to those who walk in it: 
      6 “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; 
      I will take you by the hand and keep you; 
      I will give you as a covenant for the people, 
      a light for the nations, 
      7 to open the eyes that are blind, 
      to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, 
      from the prison those who sit in darkness. 
      8 I am the LORD; that is my name; 
      my glory I give to no other, 
      nor my praise to carved idols. 
      9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, 
      and new things I now declare; 
      before they spring forth 
      I tell you of them.”
</pre>

My God,

If I lived then, you were calling me just the same. 

Lord, I will need you to give me your grace. I need your Son to bleed and die for me. I need your Spirit so I might be *fully and truly* alive.

This righteousness you have called me? I will need yours.

Because mine is filthy.

Lord, I think I see the world and you alone are the answer. Help me preach to a dying world that needs you. 

**Sarah, my love** The work of blessing and grace in her is clear to me. Lord, make her heart more like yours and then give her the desires of her heart.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** Do the same for me. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** Give me the grace for this. I will wait for you.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** I thank you for my life.  All the time and for the rest of my life I will thank you for my life.

> **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ** 

Make the world dim. There is nothing for me here but your will and glory. 

**For my Jonathan** But Lord I cannot do this alone. Help me.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
