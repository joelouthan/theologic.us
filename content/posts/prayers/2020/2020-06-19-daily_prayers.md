## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 43:14-15
Thus says the LORD,
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
“For your sake I send to Babylon
and bring them all down as fugitives,
even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
I am the LORD, your Holy One,
the Creator of Israel, your King.”
</pre>

Oh my Lord and God,

How many times have you disciplined me and kept me to yourself? And my heart wanted to wander. Lord I repent and regret when I fought against you and your will. 

But you never gave up on me. You continued to pursue me. You let me know that you are sovereign over all and I am yours and you are mine. 

Be exalted my Lord. Thank you for sending me into exile and wilderness. Thank you for doing your work in me.  Thank you for confirming me to the image of your Son. 

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Landon. Protect Jules, Eli, Sophia, and Olivia.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

All of these prayers.  Lord heal them. Please. 

**Sarah, my love** my sweetest girl. I praise your name every day because of what you are doing in her.  But do not let her go into despair. **Be her joy now.** in this moment, you be the replacement for what you are taking out of her.  Fill her with your Spirit.  Draw her closer to you. 

Lord, would you please bless us with a child? Life comes from you alone. Please give us a child. Amen. 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** Lord thank you for your sweetness. 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** just the grace to do your will

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

Wow i don’t even know how but thank you for the sin committed against me. Now i know the depths of your love for me. And i will never confuse my dad or mom or stepmom or grandma or pastor or ex-wife for who you are. They might be sinners not saved by grace.  But you are God. There is no comparison.  

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

Your work is amazing. Keep doing this in me. Make the world dim. Light me on fire.  Let me burn for you. Only if people are coming to you. Give me grace to raise your Son up so he would draw all men to him. 

**For my Jonathan** oh I need this. But I thank you for Andrew. And I thank you for Dave. 

**This might be a little thing but how can I stave off this competitive need? Lord, redeem this.**

Is this really needed? But you know me. Be my provision.  

## Next steps

- *Elder at Frontline*
- *Internship at Frontline*
- *Management at Red Hat*
- *Student at OU*

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of your children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

**Spirit of the Living God, awaken my heart to fall in love again and again**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ
