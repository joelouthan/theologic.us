## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 34:16–17
      Seek and read from the book of the LORD: 
      Not one of these shall be missing; 
      none shall be without her mate. 
      For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, 
      and his Spirit has gathered them. 
      He has cast the lot for them; 
      his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; 
      they shall possess it forever; 
      from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
</pre>

My God, 

I have but one prayer:

<pre>
  Psalm 19:7–14

      The law of the LORD is perfect, 
      reviving the soul; 
      the testimony of the LORD is sure, 
      making wise the simple; 
      the precepts of the LORD are right, 
      rejoicing the heart; 
      the commandment of the LORD is pure, 
      enlightening the eyes; 
      the fear of the LORD is clean, 
      enduring forever; 
      the rules of the LORD are true, 
      and righteous altogether. 
      More to be desired are they than gold, 
      even much fine gold; 
      sweeter also than honey 
      and drippings of the honeycomb. 
      Moreover, by them is your servant warned; 
      in keeping them there is great reward. 
    
      Who can discern his errors? 
      Declare me innocent from hidden faults. 
      Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; 
      let them not have dominion over me! 
      Then I shall be blameless, 
      and innocent of great transgression. 
    
      Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart 
      be acceptable in your sight, 
      O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
</pre>

**Sarah, my love** - Lord, help me to be the man she sees me to be. Sanctify your servant. Refine me a million times if you have to! Don't remove your Spirit from me ever!

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Give me the fullness of your Spirit so I can be just like you. Wash away my sin. Cleanse me from all unrighteousness. Make me just like you so that I can glorify you all of my days.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - Lord, always grace. I have nothing else. You called me but just like Noah, I need your grace to go along with the calling. They are forever connected: I cannot live with one without the other. Blessed be your holy name.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - Let my testimony be sure and quick to point to your Son. If they want to be saved, then they MUST turn to your Son. I got nothing else. I got the Bread but I got it from someone else.

**For my Jonathan** - I cannot do this alone. Even the most introverted had people. Lord I need real mean in my life to walk with me--even if that is for a moment. I will accept your good timing. I am so afraid of straying and wandering away like I have done a million times before. Be with me.
