## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 42:14–17
      For a long time I have held my peace; 
      I have kept still and restrained myself; 
      now I will cry out like a woman in labor; 
      I will gasp and pant. 
      15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, 
      and dry up all their vegetation; 
      I will turn the rivers into islands, 
      and dry up the pools. 
      16 And I will lead the blind 
      in a way that they do not know, 
      in paths that they have not known 
      I will guide them. 
      I will turn the darkness before them into light, 
      the rough places into level ground. 
      These are the things I do, 
      and I do not forsake them. 
      17 They are turned back and utterly put to shame, 
      who trust in carved idols, 
      who say to metal images, 
      “You are our gods.”
</pre>

Lord, I do believe that your wrath is real and it was for me--for it says I was once a vessel made for destruction.

But Your grace overflowed for me in the faith and love that are in my only Lord Jesus.

You are my righteousness.

Destroy my idols--whatever they might be. Let this world go dim. Give me your glory.

**Sarah, my love** 

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

**“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

**For my Jonathan** 

For all of this, I thank you.

Lord, please provide for me so I can quit my job and be a minister. I want enough money so my family will be taken care of and I can just preach your word and pastor your people for the rest of my life.  I know that the world sees this as impossible and a pipedream but I know you are my Father in heaven and I know that you always take care of yours children and you will always take care of me. I don’t need gobs of riches. I just need enough. You are always my portion and my lot.  Thank you for answering prayers. I love you.  Thank you for this calling.  Thank you for leading me to here. Thank you for loving me and for the grace to sustain and preserve me. Amen.

## Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?
2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*
3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*
4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 
5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth
6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.
B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God
C. Church is a community centered on Christ

  Psalm 16:1–11
      Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge. 
      I say to the LORD, “You are my Lord; 
      I have no good apart from you.” 

      As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, 
      in whom is all my delight. 
    
      The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; 
      their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out 
      or take their names on my lips. 
    
      The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; 
      you hold my lot. 
      The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; 
      indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 
    
      I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; 
      in the night also my heart instructs me. 
      I have set the LORD always before me; 
      because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken. 
    
      Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; 
      my flesh also dwells secure. 
      For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, 
      or let your holy one see corruption. 
    
      You make known to me the path of life; 
      in your presence there is fullness of joy; 
      at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
</pre>
