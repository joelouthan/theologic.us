## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

**Isaiah 37:15–20 And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:  “O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.  Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.  Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,  and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.  So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.”** 

My Lord, 

Despite my fears and anguish, my pride and my anger. Lord, answer my call despite myself. You, O Lord, are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. 

**Sarah, my love** - Thank you for the sweet work in here. Lord, lead us where you want us to go. I don't think that her controlling on what she shares with other people's complaints is helpful. But Lord, have your way.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Thank you for this work. But I need more.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** -Thank you for grace. Point out where I can share the gospel.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** - Thank you for my life. Now please save your people.

**For my Jonathan** -Thank you Lord for what you are doing.
