## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
Isaiah 44:24-28
Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
who formed you from the womb:
“I am the LORD, who made all things,
who alone stretched out the heavens,
who spread out the earth by myself,
who frustrates the signs of liars
and makes fools of diviners,
who turns wise men back
and makes their knowledge foolish,
who confirms the word of his servant
and fulfills the counsel of his messengers,
who says of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be inhabited,’
and of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built,
and I will raise up their ruins’;
who says to the deep, ‘Be dry;
I will dry up your rivers’;
who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,
and he shall fulfill all my purpose’;
saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’
and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”

I will worship you
Almighty God
There is none like you

I will worship 
O Prince of Peace
That is what I long to do 

I will give you praise
For you are my righteousness

I will worship you 
Almighty God 
There is none like you

My Savior God,

Please give us a baby. 

Please change my job. 

Please make me a preacher and a pastor and a teacher. 

Please heal me

Please make my heart just like yours 

Please renew my mind 

Please be my provision 

Please be my vision

Be my Lord

Do not let your spirit depart me 

Give me rest.  

Amen.
