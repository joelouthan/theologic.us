## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre>
  Isaiah 40:12–26

      Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand 
      and marked off the heavens with a span, 
      enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure 
      and weighed the mountains in scales 
      and the hills in a balance? 
      Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD, 
      or what man shows him his counsel? 
      Whom did he consult, 
      and who made him understand? 
      Who taught him the path of justice, 
      and taught him knowledge, 
      and showed him the way of understanding? 
      Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, 
      and are accounted as the dust on the scales; 
      behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust. 
      Lebanon would not suffice for fuel, 
      nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering. 
      All the nations are as nothing before him, 
      they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness. 
    
      To whom then will you liken God, 
      or what likeness compare with him? 
      An idol! A craftsman casts it, 
      and a goldsmith overlays it with gold 
      and casts for it silver chains. 
      He who is too impoverished for an offering 
      chooses wood that will not rot; 
      he seeks out a skillful craftsman 
      to set up an idol that will not move. 
    
      Do you not know? Do you not hear? 
      Has it not been told you from the beginning? 
      Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
      It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, 
      and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; 
      who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, 
      and spreads them like a tent to dwell in; 
      who brings princes to nothing, 
      and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness. 
    
      Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, 
      scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, 
      when he blows on them, and they wither, 
      and the tempest carries them off like stubble. 
    
      To whom then will you compare me, 
      that I should be like him? says the Holy One. 
      Lift up your eyes on high and see: 
      who created these? 
      He who brings out their host by number, 
      calling them all by name; 
      by the greatness of his might 
      and because he is strong in power, 
      not one is missing.
</pre>

My God,

You are Lord above the heavens and the earth. There is absolutely none like you.

My flesh wanders far away. Be my hound and strong tower. Take me back to your presence and keep me there forever.

My God, I need guidance. I think you are prompting me in one direction. So give me the fullness of your Spirit and you wisdom. Walk with me. Talk with me. Take me by the hand and lead me where you want me to go.

**Sarah, my love** - Be with her. Give her the desires of your heart.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Thank you for this. Even when I am at my end and my flesh has failed, I see that you are my God and you dwell in me. I exalt your name forever.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - Thank you for this grace.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** Thank you for this life.

**For my Jonathan** - Thank you for your deliverance.

### Church

**Lord, what do you want your church to be? What have you seen your Bride to be? Align me with that!**

**God, who am I and what is my purpose?**

1. **Our relationship with the truth** - *Is there absolute truth or is there just my truth that I have to seek out?* - Where have I pieced together my own truth?

2. **Suspicion of all authority** - *Is all authority corrupted? Is the authority of Jesus corrupted?*

3. **Deconstruction of everything** - *Strip away everything and then cut the truth against my subjective prespective and experience*

4. **Expressive individualism** - *With or without boundaries and order? Freedom from or freedom to Christ?* 

5. **Consumerism** - *Going from citizens to individual; church as business; customer is always right* Pragmatism vs. Absolute Truth

6. **Instituational Corruption and Decline** -  *Cynical of all instituations: church, marriage, family, politics, education*

> **Ephesians 3:7–12 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.**

A. Church is the manifest wisdom of God that God continually preaches to angels.

B. Church is formed and continually sustained by the grace of God

C. Church is a community centered on Christ
