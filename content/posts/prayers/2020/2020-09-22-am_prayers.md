> **2 Timothy 4:1-5 (ESV) I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.**

**Isaiah 61 (ESV)**

**The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,**

**because the LORD has anointed me**

**to bring good news to the poor;**

**he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,**

**to proclaim liberty to the captives,**

**and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;**

**to proclaim the year of the LORD'S favor,**

**and the day of vengeance of our God;**

**to comfort all who mourn;**

**to grant to those who mourn in Zion—**

**to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,**

**the oil of gladness instead of mourning,**

**the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;**

**that they may be called oaks of righteousness,**

**the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.**

**They shall build up the ancient ruins;**

**they shall raise up the former devastations;**

**they shall repair the ruined cities,**

**the devastations of many generations.**



**Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;**

**foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;**

**but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;**

**they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;**

**you shall eat the wealth of the nations,**

**and in their glory you shall boast.**

**Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;**

**instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;**

**therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;**

**they shall have everlasting joy.**



**For I the LORD love justice;**

**I hate robbery and wrong;**

**I will faithfully give them their recompense,**

**and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.**

**Their offspring shall be known among the nations,**

**and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;**

**all who see them shall acknowledge them,**

**that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.**



**I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;**

**my soul shall exult in my God,**

**for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;**

**he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,**

**as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,**

**and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.**

**For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,**

**and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,**

**so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise**

**to sprout up before all the nations.**

# Pray to preach the gospel

> **2 Timothy 1:6-12 (CSB) Therefore, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but one of power, love, and sound judgment.**

> **So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me his prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God. He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began. This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. For this gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher, and that is why I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.**


# for Sarah and her friends

**Sarah & Melissa**

**Sarah & Steph**

**Sarah & Erin**

**Sarah & Faith**

Lord God Almighty,

Who was, and is, and is to come,

Please bring Christ-exalting, cross-prophesying, blood covered, Spirit-filled, God glorifying, deep friendships to my sweetest Sarah. Until then, equip me to be God-worthy friend. Show me how I can lift her up and point her to your Son.

In our lives and in our friendship, relationship, and marriage, Lord, be glorified today.


# Give thanks

Lord, 

I give thanks to you, Almighty God. 

There is none like you. 

I worship you, O Prince of Peace, 

that is what I long to do.

I'll give you praise 

for you alone are my righteousness.

I worship you, Almighty God. 

There is none like you.

You have answered my prayers time and time and time again.

I called on you. And you answered. And you came to their rescue. 

You are my wonderful God in heaven.


# For healing

My Lord,

I pray for that you would heal:

Sean - vertigo double focus. Lord heal his mind and body. Give him rest and peace. Lord show him the love you have for him.

Heal Kim Feighner - Lord, you are her healer and strength. But God, she trembles in fear with sleep. I pray that you give her you unmatched and quite frankly, unknown and unexperienced peace that we cannot know in the natural but can only come by you--for you are holy and righteous and infinitely far from sin. You alone are good. Be her Comfort. Give her the fullness of your Spirit. Lord, that she may worship you all of her days.

Heal Randy (Jordan Mayfield's dad) - medical complications and lots of attention; praying for healing and peace

Heal Ron & Karen - Lord, would you give Ron strength one more time to walk his daughter down the aisle?

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.


# Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**


# Next steps

My God,

I am so uncertain. What are my next steps? Direct me, Holy Spirit.

But I will praise you for the triple blessings of being with the staff. Bless them and keep them always.

Amen


# For those who do not know You

My Lord above,

Call on me. I will be obedient. Tell me with whom shall I share your good news: you are Jesus and you have saved his people from their sins. If they believe and trust in you, they will live.

# Discipleship Group

Lord,

There is an full assault on your sons and daughters. Satan and his demons and the world is waging against us and it is all out.

God, you shall protect us because you are our shield.

But Lord, just like the mighty men of David, we are here to fight our sin and choke it with our bare hands until it dies.

We need your salvation. You have to cover us with your righteousness. Give us the call the strap our feet with the gospel of your peace. We need the gift of faith. We need your word.

Magnify and glorify Christ in us. 

Shatter the gates of hell.

I love you so much.

- Caden & Grasha ('hood kids)
- My good friend Chris who is the family pastor back at our old church in SC called me late last night from the hospital. His son Caleb (16yo, one of Timothy’s best friends) went to the ER for blurriness in his eye. Prelim diagnosis (they are waiting for an MRI today) is optic neuritis. That’s often (50% of the time) a precursor to MS down the road.

# City of Norman

**Kids back to virtual school with working parent(s)**

Lord, be the solution. What can we do?

**City of Norman**
- Mayor Breea Clark
- Councilperson Elizabeth Foreman

I pray against attacks on our leaders. Shield their eyes and hearts.

But Father, if they do not know you, please turn their hearts towards you.

Lord bless my city and her people. 

> **1 Chronicles 29:18 O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.**

> **Acts 17:32 - 18:11 (CSB) When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to ridicule him, but others said, “We’d like to hear from you again about this.” So Paul left their presence. However, some people joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.**

> **After this, he left Athens and went to Corinth, where he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul came to them, and since they were of the same occupation, tentmakers by trade, he stayed with them and worked. He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.**

> **When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself to preaching the word and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. When they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his clothes and told them, “Your blood is on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole household. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.**

> **The Lord said to Paul in a night vision, “Don’t be afraid, but keep on speaking and don’t be silent. For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I have many people in this city.” He stayed there a year and a half, teaching the word of God among them.**
