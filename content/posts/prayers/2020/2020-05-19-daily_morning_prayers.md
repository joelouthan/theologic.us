## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

My God,

What joy have I found in you! This world has nothing for me and I hope and pray it grows cold and dim to my eyes as your love and glory shines brightly.

But how I can see you when I cannot behold your glory when I have done wicked things?

You've sent your Son to live for me and to die for me; to raise from the dead for me and to glory for me.

I will magnify and exalt your name on high.

**Sarah, my love** - Thank you for your love and her heart. Turn her affections towards you forever.

**Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** - Lord, help me.

**Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** - Lord, all I ask is for grace.

**Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. â€”Henry Martyn** - Lord, let my life glorify your name forever.

**For my Jonathan** - Thank you for the strong relationships you have given me. I thank you and praise you.
