  Isaiah 38:16â€“20

      O Lord, by these things men live, 
      and in all these is the life of my spirit. 
      Oh restore me to health and make me live! 
      Behold, it was for my welfare 
      that I had great bitterness; 
      but in love you have delivered my life 
      from the pit of destruction, 
      for you have cast all my sins 
      behind your back. 
      For Sheol does not thank you; 
      death does not praise you; 
      those who go down to the pit do not hope 
      for your faithfulness. 
      The living, the living, he thanks you, 
      as I do this day; 
      the father makes known to the children 
      your faithfulness. 
    
      The LORD will save me, 
      and we will play my music on stringed instruments 
      all the days of our lives, 
      at the house of the LORD.

My God,

I pray for my own soul

I don't face persecution by the Beast. But I am constantly seduced by the Whore of Babylon. And a little confusion, a minor inconvenience, and a tiny offense will easily send me into the arms of the whore.

But you are the Lord my God who rescues me constantly, consistently, and without fail. Your salvation is like your mercies: new every morning. That is because great is your faithfulness.

Lord, none of these people might never face persecution and weakening. But be their strength.

But all of these people are constantly being seduced. The world thinks they are too far gone and they may think they have sinned too much. But your Son blood and pain was more than enough to cover their sins.

Lord, magnify your righteousness and love in every single persons life. Be exalted in our lives.

Save

every

single

person

on

this

list.

And receive every bit of glory. Because you are the only one who deserves it. You are God Almighty.
