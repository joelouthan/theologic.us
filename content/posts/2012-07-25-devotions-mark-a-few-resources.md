Here just the very small list of resources on Mark that I have found most helpful.[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-69" title="170px-Stmark" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/170px-Stmark.jpg?resize=170%2C460" width="170" height="460" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

**The Bible** &#8211; Should go without say. However, many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will &#8220;cut straight to the chase&#8221; and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without errorâ€”they are the observations of the author. Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

[**ESV Study Bible**][2] &#8211; Incredible resource. I use the [online][3] more than the actual book.

**['Devotions: Mark' (NICNT)][4] by William L. Lane** &#8211; Incredible thorough and wonderfully written, Dr. Lane walks the reader masterfully through not only the Gospel but the perspective of the writer Mark.

**[Calvin&#8217;s Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke)][5] by John Calvin** &#8211; I like to keep an old school commentary for better perspective. (Note: if you don&#8217;t find the exact passage in this commentary, just locate the commentary for the similar passages in Matthew and Luke.

[**Savior of the Suffering (Mark) at Internet Monk**][6] &#8211; I was looking for a cool Byzantine picture of St. Mark and ran into this very cool resource that lays out Mark, using the aforementioned Lane commentary as resource, for your studying pleasure.

**<a title="Mark by R.C. Sproul" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1567692656/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=iamlipr-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1567692656&adid=0FN87NDVRXDJWXA56RFZ&" target="_blank">Mark (St. Andrews Expositional Commentary) by R.C. Sproul</a>** &#8211; I got this for my birthday this year. As I reading from page 1, I am using this as a reference for where we were at. Excellently written and a real joy to read thus far.

**Update:

  1. Added the book, Mark by R.C. Sproul
