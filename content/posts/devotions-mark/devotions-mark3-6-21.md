## The Introduction

When you read the Gospel of Mark, if nothing else, if you are even halfway paying attention, is that Christ is one of action.

We have read where Jesus heals, prays, accepts sinners, forgive sinners, heals hearts, and preaches the gospel.

But Christ was no ordinary man who did a bunch of great and even supernatural things. Christ is the Son of God who was God. And while he was here ministering on earth, he was filled with the Holy Spirit.

But did Christ come on his own. No. He didn't minister on his own. But he did not come on his own. 

The Father, our Father in Heaven, sent Christ here. And it wasn't a casual vacation. It was a mission not to heal a bunch of people, rebuke legalists, or even to preach the gospel--although, Christ did all of that and then some.

Christ singularly focused to rescue his people from their sins.

## The Text

>Mark 3:6-19 (CSB) Immediately the Pharisees went out and started plotting with the Herodians against him, how they might kill him.
>
>Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed from Galilee, and a large crowd followed from Judea,
>
><sup> 8 </sup>Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to him because they heard about everything he was doing.
>
><sup> 9 </sup>Then he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, so that the crowd wouldn’t crush him.
>
><sup> 10 </sup>Since he had healed many, all who had diseases were pressing toward him to touch him.
>
><sup> 11 </sup>Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”
>
><sup> 12 </sup>And he would strongly warn them not to make him known.
>
>13 Jesus went up the mountain and summoned those he wanted, and they came to him.
>
><sup> 14 </sup>He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, to send them out to preach,
>
><sup> 15 </sup>and to have authority to drive out demons.
>
><sup> 16 </sup>He appointed the Twelve: To Simon, he gave the name Peter;
>
><sup> 17 </sup>and to James the son of Zebedee, and to his brother John, he gave the name “Boanerges” (that is, “Sons of Thunder”);
>
><sup> 18 </sup>Andrew; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot,
>
><sup> 19 </sup>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

## The Devotion

### People wanted to kill Christ

><sup> 6 </sup>Immediately the Pharisees went out and started plotting with the Herodians against him, how they might kill him.

... but fail and fail again because Christ is life.

### People wanted to make him king because Jesus provided what they needed--food and healing

><sup> 7 </sup>Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed from Galilee, and a large crowd followed from Judea,
>
><sup> 8 </sup>Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to him because they heard about everything he was doing.

... but Jesus had so much more to give. Jesus Christ gives eternal life to all that trust and obey him.

### Despite the masses that wanted him to heal them, so few wanted to be his disciple

><sup> 9 </sup>Then he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, so that the crowd wouldn’t crush him.
>
><sup> 10 </sup>Since he had healed many, all who had diseases were pressing toward him to touch him.

... but Jesus wants you to be with him.

### Demons wanted to try to mess up the mission of God

><sup> 11 </sup>Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”
>
><sup> 12 </sup>And he would strongly warn them not to make him known.

... but demons cannot mess up God's plan because Jesus completely rules over demons.

### Jesus reveals the 12 Disciples that will walk with him, when others won't

>13 Jesus went up the mountain and summoned those he wanted, and they came to him.
>
><sup> 14 </sup>He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, to send them out to preach,
>
><sup> 15 </sup>and to have authority to drive out demons.
>
><sup> 16 </sup>He appointed the Twelve: To Simon, he gave the name Peter;
>
><sup> 17 </sup>and to James the son of Zebedee, and to his brother John, he gave the name “Boanerges” (that is, “Sons of Thunder”);
>
><sup> 18 </sup>Andrew; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot,
>
><sup> 19 </sup>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

Therefore, we are no less than the 12 disciples of Christ. We are to go and preach his good news and with his authority, expand His kingdom and press up against the gates of Hell.

>Mark 16:14-16 (CSB) Later he appeared to the Eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he had risen. 15 Then he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

### Jesus had just one mission: from his Father with the power of His Spirit, he came to earth to save His people

## The Discussion

```text
1. Why did people wanted to kill Christ?

2. Why did people want to touch and be near Christ?

3. Why are demons so quick to fall and tremble and confess that Christ is the Son of God?

4. Why are people so slow to fall, tremble, and confess that Christ is the Son of God?

5. Jesus called the 12 Disciples to minister to him--are we called like the Disciples? How?

6. What was Christ sent here to do?
```

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
