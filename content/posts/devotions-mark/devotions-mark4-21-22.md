## The Text

>Mark 4:21–22 (CSB)  
><sup> 21 </sup> He also said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it to be put on a lampstand? 

><sup> 22 </sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light.

## The Devotion

If we believe, trust, hope, and obey in Jesus Christ our Lord, do we keep it a secret or do we live this new life that we have received by God?

## The Discussion

```text
1. What did Christ come to do?

2. How did he do it?
```

>1 John 2:1-6 (CSB) My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the righteous one. 2 He himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world. 3 This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commands. 4 The one who says, “I have come to know him,” and yet doesn’t keep his commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete. This is how we know we are in him: 6 The one who says he remains in him should walk just as he walked.

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.

```text
3. Can you hide from God? Can you keep secrets from God?

4. When you do something bad in secret, should you try to hide it in your heart and mind or run to God who will always forgive your sins?
```

## The Prayer from the Psalms

>

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
Father of lights
</div>

```text
Shine the light of your life upon us. Expose our sins for all of days. Give us the gift of repentance to turn to your Son and confess our sins. To give them over so we can receive the righteousness of life.

We love you forever.

Amen.
```
