## The Text

>Mark 9:30-32 (CSB)  
><sup> 30 </sup> Then they left that place and made their way through Galilee, but he did not want anyone to know it. 

><sup> 31 </sup> For he was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after he is killed, he will rise three days later.” 

><sup> 32 </sup> But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him.

## The Devotion

Christ is the Lord over Death. We examine this in [Mark 5:35-43](/home-devotions/2021-11-11-home-devos-mark/) where Christ is Lord over both our lives which means our deaths. He knows when we will die because our days are numbered by him:

>Psalm 139:16 (CSB) Your eyes saw me when I was formless; all my days were written in your book and planned before a single one of them began.

Yet, Christ alone is the resurrection of our souls and the life of our bodies:

>John 11:25 (CSB) Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live.

Here is the big facts: if the historical, real Jesus Christ predicted his own death, several times over, and then predicted his own resurrection, several times over, then can you not trust him with your own life?

>John 11:26 (CSB) Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”

The Bible is absolute truth. God is absolutely real. Christ has come to live and die so that His people will be saved. 

Christ has given the gospel commandment:

>Mark 1:15 (CSB) “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

The good news is this: we are born to die and we are born in sin against the holy God. God is calling on you not to live your own life unto death but to be born again until eternal life. The way it should have been from the beginning.

The question remains. Believe. If you believe, then live like you believe. How do you do that? Repent.

## The Discussion

```text
1. When do you think that the disciples finally understood this?
```

```text
2. Do you understand what Christ said?
```

```text
3. Do you trust what Christ had said?
```

```text
4. Will you live as though you believe?
```

## The Prayer from the Psalms

>

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
The Light of my Life
</div>

```text
I repent now. Of all of my sins.

Turn me towards you and keep me all of my days.

Bring me home.

Amen.
```
