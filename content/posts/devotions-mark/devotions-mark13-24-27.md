## The Text

>Mark 13:24–27 (CSB)  
><sup> 24 </sup> “But in those days, after that tribulation: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light; 

><sup> 25 </sup> the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 

><sup> 27 </sup> He will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.

## The Devotion

The Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God who is God who created the heavens and the earth and under the earth. He created all things. He created us, humans--mankind--male and female.

And then we rebelled against this Creator. He did not smite us. He did not shame us. He did not destroyed us. None of that. He saved us.

God preaches His great gospel:

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.

The gospel that is His power to save us:

>Romans 1:16–17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

And Christ, literally, historically, factually appeared on this earth some 2000 years ago. 

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

And the Bible, although has history in it, is not primarily a history book but rather a theological book. History books, Christian and secular alike, all triple confirm that Jesus of Nazareth walked this earth and did the things he did--miracles, signs and wonders, forgave sins, taught and preached with great authority. Then he was illegally arrested, tried and executed upon the cross. 

But because Christ is holy, good, right, and just and God, he resurrected from the grave on the third day.

>Titus 3:4–5 (CSB) But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 5 he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.

He did not just appear to his closest friends or just his disciples. He appeared to hundreds of witnesses. Then ascended to heavens.

This is the same God who tells us:

>Mark 13:24–26 (CSB)“But in those days, after that tribulation: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light; the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.

Christ is coming back to judge the living and the dead.

Christ has done it all and he will do it all. He alone will make all things righteous. See the things he has done to save you. You are saved. You are called to believe, trust, and obey the Son of God who is God. 

Will you do it perfectly? No. That is the point. Will you rest in Him and "enter in the joy of your master"? That is on Christ. Just rest in him. See what he has said and know he will be back for us.

## Prayer from the Psalms

>Psalm 20 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>May the LORD answer you in a day of trouble; may the name of Jacob’s God protect you.

><sup> 2  </sup>May he send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.

><sup> 3  </sup>May he remember all your offerings and accept your burnt offering. Selah

><sup> 4  </sup>May he give you what your heart desires and fulfill your whole purpose.

><sup> 5  </sup>Let us shout for joy at your victory and lift the banner in the name of our God. May the LORD fulfill all your requests.

><sup> 6  </sup>Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with mighty victories from his right hand.

><sup> 7  </sup>Some take pride in chariots, and others in horses, but we take pride in the name of the LORD our God.

><sup> 8  </sup>They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm.

><sup> 9  </sup>LORD, give victory to the king! May he answer us on the day that we call.

If I cry out for you, will you answer me?

If you alone made the provisions and the sacrifices, will you save me?

Even if I don’t understand you, will you reach for me?

I need you, Lord. I don’t even have the wisdom to reach my hands up to you.

I want you, God, and my heart is still filled with sin and wickedness.

I have you, my Lord and my God, because I have your Spirit within me all because of what Your Son has done for me.

Help me, God, help me.

Save me.

Amen
```
