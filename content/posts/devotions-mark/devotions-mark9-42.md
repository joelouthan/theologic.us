## The Text

>Mark 9:42 (CSB)  
><sup> 42 </sup> “But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to fall away—it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.

## The Devotion

So many false teachers, who preach not the gospel, who are causing his little ones to stray--presuming that there is no God and they will not have to answer for leading his sheep astray.

But his little ones are never in danger. Those who hear his voice are known and saved by the Good Shepherd:

>John 10:25-30 (CSB) “I did tell you and you don’t believe,” Jesus answered them. “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify about me. But you don’t believe because you are not of my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

Likewise, woe to false shepherds. The heart of Christ towards his lambs are so tender and jealous, he promises he will stop at nothing to take care of them:

>Jeremiah 23:1-4 (CSB) oe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” This is the LORD’s declaration. “Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I am about to attend to you because of your evil acts”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous. I will raise up shepherds over them who will tend them. They will no longer be afraid or discouraged, nor will any be missing.” This is the LORD’s declaration.

The Almighty God will attend to you, false prophet, false teacher, false shepherd.

But there is hope. For you. If you repent and trust and believe Christ because His kingdom is here and your little kingdom is nothing but dung in comparison.

Christ alone is mighty to beat and remove the wolves. Christ alone is mighty to save.

Who can save us? Who is able to save us? Who is willing to save us?

Only one person fits the bill for all three.

### Mighty to save: Christ can save

>Isaiah 63:1 (CSB) Who is this coming from Edom
in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah—
this one who is splendid in his apparel,
striding in his formidable might?
It is I, proclaiming vindication,
powerful to save.

### Mighty to save: Christ is able to save

>Hebrews 7:25 (CSB) Therefore, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, since he always lives to intercede for them.

### Mighty to save: Christ is willing to save

>Romans 7:24 - 8:2 (CSB) What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin. Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.

### Mighty to save: Christ will save

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

### Mighty to save: Christ has saved

>2 Timothy 1:8-10 (CSB) So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me his prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God. He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began. This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
