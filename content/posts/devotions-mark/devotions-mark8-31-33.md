## The Text

>Mark 8:31–33 (CSB)  
><sup> 31 </sup> Then he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and rise after three days. 

><sup> 32 </sup> He spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 

><sup> 33 </sup> But turning around and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! You are not thinking about God’s concerns but human concerns.”

## The Devotion

### Christ died for his people: because we were not good but sinners all the day long

>Romans 5:8-9 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.

### Christ died for his people: in order to save us

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

### Christ died for his people: in order to forgive our sins

>Hebrews 9:22 (CSB) According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

### Christ died for his people: perfectly, completely once to bear the sins of all us

>Hebrews 9:27-28 (CSB) And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment—28 so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

### Christ died for his people: to be the wrath-absorbing, atoning sacrifice for our sins

>1 John 4:9-10 (CSB) God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

### Christ died for his people: because he loved us

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

### Christ died for his people: so that we would not be condemned and not perish in our sins but have everlasting life

>John 3:14-18 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. 16 For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Anyone who believes in him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.

### Christ died for his people: he is the death of death so we might die to sin and live to God forever

>Romans 6:8-11 (CSB) Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, 9 because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. 10 For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 11 So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Would it be possible for God to save his people without Christ dying?
```

```text
2. What about the shedding of blood from the Old Testament? Did that save the people from their sins?
```
>Hebrews 10:3-4 (CSB) But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

```text
3. Do you believe that God can save you?
```

```text
4. Do you trust that God has saved you?
```

## The Prayer from the Psalms

>

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
My Living God
</div>

```text
Save me right now. Save me into your joy and your presence.

Give me eternal life with you.

I need to be born again.

Save me.

Amen.
```
