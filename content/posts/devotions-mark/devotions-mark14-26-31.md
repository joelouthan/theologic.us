## The Text

>>Mark 14:26–31 (CSB) After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall away, because it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.” Peter told him, “Even if everyone falls away, I will not.” “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to him, “today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” But he kept insisting, “If I have to die with you, I will never deny you.” And they all said the same thing.

## The Devotion

There are two types of people in the world: believers and unbelievers. 

Here's the kick: both sets of people (read: everyone) has betrayed and trespasses and sin against God. Both sets of people have struck the Savior with our sin and wickedness. Whatever we did, it fell way short of the perfect glory of God.

What did God do? Eradicate his creation? No. Bear down endless wrath and force people to repent? Nope. Withdraw himself and let his creation have their way unto their deaths? Not likely.

>John 3:17 (CSB)  
> 17  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

The Father sent his Son to rescue his people from their sins. 

Everyone has sinned against the Son. Everyone. Believers and unbelievers alike. One will forever be consumed the fire of his perfect wrath. The other will be protected from his fiery wrath. 

Choose on this day on whom you will serve.

Every step that Christ took towards the cross was in complete joy and satisfaction because every step he took was one step closer to completely, satisfactorily, perfectly, definitely, absolutely, forever "save his people from their sins."
