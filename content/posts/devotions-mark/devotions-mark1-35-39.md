## The Text

>Mark 1:35-39 And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.” And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

## The Devotion

### What is prayer?
  
Worship
  
Talking
  
Giving Thanks

### Why do we pray?
  
We get to talk to our Father in heaven. We get to spend time with him. We get to kick it with him.

### When you don't get to see your dad, do you miss him? When Jesus was here on earth, do you think he missed his Father?

>Matthew 26:36-46 (CSB) When Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he told the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. He said to them, “I am deeply grieved to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.” Going a little farther, he fell facedown and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”
>
>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter, “So, couldn’t you stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake and pray, so that you won’t enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
>
>Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” And he came again and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open.
>
>After leaving them, he went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? See, the time is near. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up; let’s go. See, my betrayer is near.”

>Mark 1:35 (CSB) Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up, went out, and made his way to a deserted place; and there he was praying.

>Mark 6:46 (CSB) After he said good-bye to them, he went away to the mountain to pray.

>Luke 5:16 (CSB) Yet he often withdrew to deserted places and prayed.

>Luke 6:12 (CSB) During those days he went out to the mountain to pray and spent all night in prayer to God.

>Luke 9:28 (CSB) About eight days after this conversation, he took along Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.

>Luke 11:1 (CSB) He was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”

>John 17:1-2 (CSB) Jesus spoke these things, looked up to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, since you gave him authority over all people, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him.

### How come we get to talk to the God?
  
Because all that Christ has done for us.

>John 20:11-18 (CSB) But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she stooped to look into the tomb. She saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’s body had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”
>
>“Because they’ve taken away my Lord,” she told them, “and I don’t know where they’ve put him.”
>
>Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know it was Jesus. “Woman,” Jesus said to her, “why are you crying? Who is it that you’re seeking?”
>
>Supposing he was the gardener, she replied, “Sir, if you’ve carried him away, tell me where you’ve put him, and I will take him away.”
>
>Jesus said to her, “Mary.”
>
>Turning around, she said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!”—which means “Teacher.”
>
>“Don’t cling to me,” Jesus told her, “since I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”
>
>Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what he had said to her.

### Do you think Jesus helps us pray?
  
>Matthew 6:5-15 (CSB) “Whenever you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have their reward. But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. When you pray, don’t babble like the Gentiles, since they imagine they’ll be heard for their many words. Don’t be like them, because your Father knows the things you need before you ask him.
>
>“Therefore, you should pray like this:  
>Our Father in heaven,  
>your name be honored as holy.  
>Your kingdom come.  
>Your will be done  
>on earth as it is in heaven.  
>Give us today our daily bread.  
>And forgive us our debts,  
>as we also have forgiven our debtors.  
>And do not bring us into temptation,  
>but deliver us from the evil one.  
>“For if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don’t forgive others, your Father will not forgive your offenses.

### Do you think Jesus prays for us?
  
>John 17:9 (CSB) “I pray for them. I am not praying for the world but for those you have given me, because they are yours.

>Romans 8:34 (CSB) Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.

### Do you think the Holy Spirit helps us pray?
  
>John 14:26 (CSB) But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have told you.

### Do you think the Holy Spirit prays for us as well?
  
>Romans 8:26-27 (CSB) In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

Just like Jesus always wanted to spend time with His Father, we get to spend time with our Father in Heaven. We get to call out to him like you guys call out your daddy. God will always have time to spend with you. He is never busy. He will always listen. You can just start talking and he hears you perfectly fine. Even if you can't speak, he can read your thoughts and see what's on your heart. He will always answer prayers:

>Psalms 17:6 (CSB)  
>I call on you, God,  
>because you will answer me;  
>listen closely to me; hear what I say.
