If you ever led small group discussions or family devotions, you know that sometimes there is no smooth way to go into devotions.

Like tonight: our family was having a robust discussion on dinosaurs. In my mind, I knew we would have no other opportunities to do devotions. This is how I transitioned into devotion time:

**Me**: NO ONE MAKE A MOVE. STAY IN YOUR SEAT. IT&#8217;S&#8230;
  
**Kids**: DEVOTION TIME!

Sometimes, you&#8217;ll get an opening. Other times, unless you are about to teach on Job 40 & 41, there is no easy way to switch from dinosaur talk to the Gospel of Mark.
