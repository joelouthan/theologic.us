> <p class="p1">
>   <span class="s1">To proclaim ourselves as Christians to proclaim that we believe and trust upon Christ as our Saviour and Lord. </span>
> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At that beautiful moment when God saved us, we hope and pray that each one of us are immediately surrounded by other brothers and sisters in Christ that are willing to walk alongside us in love, encouragement, teaching and exhortation.  It is my sincere hope that no newly saved person is ever alone by themselves trying to figure this thing especially when the cross of Christ has not only saved us to Himself but we have been reconciled to each other. Here at ground zero, we are given a new heart and new desires by God.  Desires to want to know more of him, to know and love Him more and more each day. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But how is it that we are actually come to salvation by God?  This is the question that the idea of the Latin term &#8220;<em>Ordo Salutis&#8221;</em> (or the Order of Salvation) attempts to answer.  If we have some knowledge of the Bible, the better question would no doubt be: </span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><b>&#8220;What did God have to do in order to save His people to Himself?&#8221; </b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In order to answer this, we have to fully dive into the Scriptures to see what God has revealed about what salvation is.  We cannot rely on superstition, church history or simply what &#8220;feels good&#8221;.  We must seek out what God says about salvation. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So in this series, we are going to attempt answer questions such as, &#8220;Does the Bible teach about God electing us to salvation?&#8221;, &#8220;Are we predestined by God?&#8221;, &#8220;What is free will of man?&#8221; and &#8220;Can a person truly be saved without the outward appearance of a new heart?&#8221;. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So in this, we begin with the Golden Chain (emphasized in orange) found in this passage: </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Romans 8:27-30 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <span style="color: #ff6600;">And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</span></b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In verse 30, Paul did not simply throw the words &#8220;predestined&#8221;, &#8220;called&#8221;, &#8220;justified&#8221; and &#8220;glorified&#8221; at us as though their order matter not.  Paul was very careful in ordering them in the way that he did to give us the idea of what all occurred on the part of God in order to save us.  </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before we begin to take this passage apart and split into different doctrines, I want to know some of your thoughts.  Keep in mind that they are no wrong answers.  I want you to be as honest as possible because I simply want to know where you are coming from and what your perceptions are. </span>
