## What this is not about

I am a great believer in the local church. That said, as of this writing, my local church has **not** ordained me to pastor any local congregation.

I desire to preach the great gospel of Christ. By God's great grace and will, I might be able to do so. Until then, I will sit with and gather with my brothers and sisters under the preached word and worship our great God together.
