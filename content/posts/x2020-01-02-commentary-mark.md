**Mark 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.** 

By no means was the previous chapter to be an exhaustive list. But understand how vital and crucial it is to know *who* God is by what God has said about himself. Now, why is that so important? Because if you place your ears and tune them into the world and even what some Christians will say and believe about God? It might sound good or even feel good but is that what God said about himself?

And for some of you who thinks it is easy to take information at face value and simply *believe* it, do you see what God has said about himself and believe it? Do you hear what He says and by your belief in Him, do what He says? Ah, there in lies the rub. So often we want to say that we believe and even trust God with our mouths but our actions and our lives reflect none the sort.

Now, some of you might push back and declare to me, "Are you saying that we have to obey perfectly in order to be saved? That is impossible!" I am not saying that because it is impossible. Yet, perfect obedience was already brought to us for those who believe and obey the Son of God by the Son of God who is Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.

And some of you might even say, "But I do obey God therefore I must be saved." I would caution against that belief.  **I John 1:8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us** and **James 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it**. We must be careful not assume our salvation based on our obedience to God. We are given grace not because we obey God but we are given grace *to* obey God. Remember, both the unbeliever and the believer might do the very things that God has commanded us to do but only one of them will be counted as righteous to God.

> Luke 18:9-14 He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt:  Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.  I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.  But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner!  **I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other.** For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.  

Isaiah declares this ultimately in 64:6 **We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.** 

In other words, there is nothing that you can do to save yourself. You cannot believe harder, try harder, love more, cry more, or talk in tongues all the more. None of that saves you. It is not the things that you do but the Whom you put your trust in: the Holy One of God that is Christ Jesus.

You can only obey God when you fully trust that God says who he is, you fully believe what God says he has done, and you fully take of hold the promises that He has given.

It is only then you will *truly and fully* be alive.

*Who is Jesus*
