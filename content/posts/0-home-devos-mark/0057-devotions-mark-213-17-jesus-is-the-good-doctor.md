## The Text

>Mark 2:13-17 (CSB) Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. 14 Then, passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me,” and he got up and followed him.
>
>15 While he was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him. 16 When the scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
>
>17 When Jesus heard this, he told them, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

## The Devotion

>Romans 3:10-12 (CSB) as it is written:  
>There is no one righteous, not even one.  
>11 There is no one who understands;  
>there is no one who seeks God.  
>12 All have turned away;  
>all alike have become worthless.  
>There is no one who does what is good,  
>not even one.

There are two ways of knowing this:

1. In our heads but our hearts will either question it or deny it
2. We believe this to our core and we need God.

## The Discussion

```text
1. If you think you are already good, can you be saved by God?

2. If you think what you do and don't do makes you good, can you be saved by God?

3. What does the Scriptures say? Is everybody good or everyone bad?

4. Who needs to be saved from death?
```
