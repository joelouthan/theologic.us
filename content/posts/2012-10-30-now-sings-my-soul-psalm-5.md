<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My King and my God,
</div>

My heart grieves. My soul groans. I am in need of your Spirit.

My own pride has kept me far from you. My own arrogance has caused you to look away. Yet, I am in need of your holiness—the very thing that keeps me far is the very thing that keeps me close.

Clean my lips.

Give me your heart.

Remove this poison from my throat. Smooth the rawness and ease the pain.

Let me speak life into everyone and everything around me.

I don’t want my tongue to be a filthy dagger. I want it to be a tool that lifts the lowly to godly; sin to righteous; and hopelessness to joy everlasting.

Oh Lord, teach me your songs.

Let me learn the songs you sing over me. I will gladly sing them over your people.

Cover me. Protect me. Keep me in your hands.

In your Son’s mighty name I pray,

Amen.

**Series: **As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very _personal and intimate nature_ of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.
