<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  Dear God,
</div>

I have seen the volley of artillery rain down all around me and You, O Lord, my precious shield, have absorbed their attacks.

Yet, the enemy’s sharpshooters have taken careful aim at my heart. Their fiery bullets have pierced my chest. Their lies have penetrated my mind. Their blasphemous words have laid weight upon my soul.

It hurts me so.

But You, O God, are endlessly faithful:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Faithful to save.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Faithful to heal.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Faithful to restore.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Faithful to equip.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Faithful to send.
</p>

My Commander of Hosts, help me in my moment of despair. My feet, which are strapped with Your gospel of peace, have been firmly planted into the Rock of Ages. I will and cannot retreat. I shall not be moved.

You see, your victory is complete.

Your finished work continues to grow in ranks by the indwelling of your Holy Spirit, the swelling of our hearts and the changing of our minds. Your kingdom presses against the gates of hell. I can now hear the rivets popping from the weight of your awesome glory.

May I continue to herald your great works and your great name for the rest of my days.

In your name, I pray.

Amen.

**Series: **As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very _personal and intimate nature_ of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.
