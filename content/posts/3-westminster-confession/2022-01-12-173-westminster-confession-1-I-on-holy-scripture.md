## The Introduction 



## The Text

>1 Corinthians 2:12-16 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God. We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people. But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from Godâ€™s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually. The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, and yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone. For  
>**who has known the Lordâ€™s mind,**  
>**that he may instruct him?**  
>
>But we have the mind of Christ.

## The Article

1.I Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of His will, which is necessary unto salvation; therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal Himself, and to declare that His will unto His church; and afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former ways of Godâ€™s revealing His will unto His people being now ceased.

## The Confession

I am coming into the study with a few expectations. One of which is that I am 99.999999% sure I am not going to disagree with any article. And right out the gate, none of these points really grinds my gears.

Lets walk through the points:

### Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; 




### yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of His will, which is necessary unto salvation;


### therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal Himself, 


### and to declare that His will unto His church; 


### and afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, 


### and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world,


### to commit the same wholly unto writing;


### which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary; 


### those former ways of Godâ€™s revealing His will unto His people being now ceased.
