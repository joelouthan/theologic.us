<pre><blockquote>
  The sea, dry land, winter cold, summer heat,
    morning light, evening shade are full of thee,
    and thou givest me them richly to enjoy.
  Thou art King of kings and Lord of lords;
  At thy pleasure empires rise and fall;
  All thy works praise thee and thy saints bless thee;
    Let me be numbered with thy holy ones,
    resemble them in character and condition,
    sit with them at Jesusâ€™ feet.
</blockquote></pre>
