> Psalm 53 (CSB)
For the choir director: on Mahalath. A Maskil of David. 

      The fool says in his heart, “There’s no God.” 
      They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds. 
      There is no one who does good. 
      God looks down from heaven on the human race 
      to see if there is one who is wise, 
      one who seeks God. 
      All have turned away; 
      all alike have become corrupt. 
      There is no one who does good, 
      not even one. 

      Will evildoers never understand? 
      They consume my people as they consume bread; 
      they do not call on God. 
      Then they will be filled with dread—
      dread like no other—
      because God will scatter 
      the bones of those who besiege you. 
      You will put them to shame, 
      for God has rejected them. 

      Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion! 
      When God restores the fortunes of his people, 
      let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
