```> Psalm 48 (CSB)
A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
      The LORD is great and highly praised 
      in the city of our God. 
      His holy mountain, rising splendidly, 
      is the joy of the whole earth. 
      Mount Zion—the summit of Zaphon—
      is the city of the great King. 
      God is known as a stronghold 
      in its citadels.
      Look! The kings assembled; 
      they advanced together. 
      They looked and froze with fear; 
      they fled in terror. 
      Trembling seized them there, 
      agony like that of a woman in labor, 
      as you wrecked the ships of Tarshish 
      with the east wind. 
      Just as we heard, so we have seen 
      in the city of the LORD of Armies, 
      in the city of our God; 
      God will establish it forever. 
                                      Selah
      God, within your temple, 
      we contemplate your faithful love. 
      Like your name, God, so your praise 
      reaches to the ends of the earth; 
      your right hand is filled with justice. 
      Mount Zion is glad. 
      Judah’s villages rejoice 
      because of your judgments.
      Go around Zion, encircle it; 
      count its towers, 
      note its ramparts; tour its citadels 
      so that you can tell a future generation: 
      “This God, our God forever and ever—
      he will always lead us.”
