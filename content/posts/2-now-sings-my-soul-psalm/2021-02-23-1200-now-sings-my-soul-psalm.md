```> Psalm 51 (CSB)
For the choir director. A psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba.
      Be gracious to me, God, 
      according to your faithful love; 
      according to your abundant compassion, 
      blot out my rebellion. 
      Completely wash away my guilt 
      and cleanse me from my sin. 
      For I am conscious of my rebellion, 
      and my sin is always before me. 
      Against you—you alone—I have sinned 
      and done this evil in your sight. 
      So you are right when you pass sentence; 
      you are blameless when you judge. 
      Indeed, I was guilty when I was born; 
      I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
      Surely you desire integrity in the inner self, 
      and you teach me wisdom deep within. 
      Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; 
      wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
      Let me hear joy and gladness; 
      let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 
      Turn your face away from my sins 
      and blot out all my guilt. 
      God, create a clean heart for me 
      and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 
      Do not banish me from your presence 
      or take your Holy Spirit from me. 
      Restore the joy of your salvation to me, 
      and sustain me by giving me a willing spirit. 
      Then I will teach the rebellious your ways, 
      and sinners will return to you.
      Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God—
      God of my salvation—
      and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. 
      Lord, open my lips, 
      and my mouth will declare your praise. 
      You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; 
      you are not pleased with a burnt offering. 
      The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. 
      You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God.
      In your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; 
      build the walls of Jerusalem. 
      Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, 
      whole burnt offerings; 
      then bulls will be offered on your altar.
