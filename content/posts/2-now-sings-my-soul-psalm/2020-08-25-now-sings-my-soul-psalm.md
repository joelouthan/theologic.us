<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;"></div>
6 Therefore let everyone who is godly 
offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; 
surely in the rush of great waters, 
they shall not reach him. 
7 You are a hiding place for me; 
you preserve me from trouble; 
you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah 
</pre>
