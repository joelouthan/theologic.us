> Psalm 47 (CSB)

For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

      Clap your hands, all you peoples; 
      shout to God with a jubilant cry. 
      For the LORD, the Most High, is awe-inspiring, 
      a great King over the whole earth. 
      He subdues peoples under us 
      and nations under our feet. 
      He chooses for us our inheritance—
      the pride of Jacob, whom he loves. 
                                      Selah 

      God ascends among shouts of joy, 
      the LORD, with the sound of a ram’s horn. 
      Sing praise to God, sing praise; 
      sing praise to our King, sing praise! 
      Sing a song of wisdom, 
      for God is King of the whole earth. 

      God reigns over the nations; 
      God is seated on his holy throne. 
      The nobles of the peoples have assembled 
      with the people of the God of Abraham. 
      For the leaders of the earth belong to God; 
      he is greatly exalted.
