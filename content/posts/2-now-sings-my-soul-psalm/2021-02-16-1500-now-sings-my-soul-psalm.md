My Only Peace
</div>

```text
You alone
  are my righteousness
  and my exalted Lord
  who rules and reigns in the heavens.

Majesty
  and my Love
  who can do what you have done?

My circumstances
  and my time here on earth
  do not define me
  nor do my sins
  nor do my actions
  nor do my desires
  nor does my heart.

Only you
  King Jesus
  give me all of my identity
  and worth
  and value.

Nothing else
  just you.
  My Lord and my Rock.

Amen.
```
