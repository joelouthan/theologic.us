<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Awe and Wonder
</div>
We know that 
sins crouched for us.  

We know that the devil
  sets his snares for our souls. 

We know that the world
  beckons our hearts towards death. 

But you alone are
  worthy to be praised

You alone are
  holy and holy and holy
  
You alone are
  righteous
  for there is none like you

I will worship you

I will give you praise

I will sing of your wondrous works

I will marvel at your law

I will dance in your heart

I will repent of all my sin

I will trust in your Son

Because you have loved me

Because your Son
  lived and died for me

Because your Spirit
  bears witness with my spirit
  that I am a son of God.

That you dwell wholly within me.

And with you in me
  I will bless your holy name forever.

Amen.
</pre>
