34:5 Those who look to him are radiant, 
      and their faces shall never be ashamed.

My God.  Keep me close to you. Let me see tour face.  Just this once. So I can behold your beauty.  If I die then so be it. Because I rather see you and die then to never see your face and never fully live. 

My God keep my eyes on your eyes my heart on your heart and my soul connected to yours.  Whatever work you must do in me do it. For j am yours and you are mine.  

I know this forever. I will never be satisfied. So long as I live.  Until I see your face. So I will run hard and fly fast and do as I please because I am so in love with you and I have absolute freedom. Never in prison yet a bond servant. Never obligated but your bride. Never ever an orphan but your son. Never alone for you are with me forever. 

Bring me home. Let me see your face. But if it isnâ€™t now then I will do your will. 
</pre>
