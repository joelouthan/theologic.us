My Only Shield of Salvation
</div>
I remembered
  being attacked
  all of my days
  and having no will to fight
  succumbing to the attacks of Satan
  easily
  like a sheep
  like a prisoner of war
  tortured
  for entertainment
  to despise your holy name.

When you saved me,
  your hand was upon me
  your shield protected me
  you healed my heart
  you mended my bones
  you restored my soul.

But just as David called his mighty men
  you called on me
  there are numerous giants to be slain
  for Satan and his demons
  have sharpened their arrows
  quickened their aim
  sure their shots.

But you are the Commander of the Most High
  and I bow at your command
  I am on your side
  you are my Lord.

Give me your will
  and with your grace
  I will make it my own
  for Your are my Redeemer and Judge
  and your resurrecting Spirit
  is always with me.

Guard me from temptation
  but give me yourself
  my Christ and Lord
  to give me the strength and endurance
  to wrap my hands
  around the necks of my gods
  my torturers
  my giants
  and crushed their windpipes
  until they fall lifeless
  and dead forever.

Sin has not conquered me
  for you alone have conquered sin
  forever.

I love you, Lord.
</pre>
