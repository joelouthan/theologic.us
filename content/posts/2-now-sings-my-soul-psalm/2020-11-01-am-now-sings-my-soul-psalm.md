<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My God</div>
While I tried to ignore
  and even 
  excuse the pain caused me.
  My body never forgets.
  
While I will make excuses
  and blameshift 
  my sins against others
  My soul remembers.
  
Your forgiveness
  does not erase my wrongdoings.
  But your Son's blood
  covers my trespasses.
  
Help me to cry out to you,
  for you are my Lord and my God
  you are my Savior and Messiah
  you are my Friend and my Brother
  you are the only one who cared for me.
  you are the only one who healed me.
  you are the only one who saved me.
  
Be exalted, O Lord.
Be lifted up higher and higher.

Amen.
</pre>
