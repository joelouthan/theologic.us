The King of my Soul,
</div>

In fury,  
  wrath  
  injustice  
  vengeance  
  rage  
  and anger  
  I cried out  
  not in righteousness of your Son  
  but if I examine my heart for a second  
  in my own self-righteousness  
  
I share  
  posts  
  memes  
  quotes  
  to try to take away the pain  
  when I should have been grieving  
  crying  
  interceding  
  and praying  
  because you have saw our iniquity  
  and you have withheld your mercy  
  and you have judged our land  
  unholy and unpleasing  
  to you.  
  
My God,  
  make me ready  
  for what you are about to do  
  make me ready  
  to be taken in by you  
  make me ready  
  so that your Son will come back  
  now  
  today  
  right now  
  so that i can be with you  
  
Every person  
  that I have ever come across  
  save them  
  save them now  
  save them quickly  
  do not hesitate  
  strip their pride  
  crack their heart open  
  step into their eternity  
  and predestined to you  
  the only and only God  
  who alone is mighty to save  
  
Save them Lord  
  Save them to the utmost  
  Save them now.  
  Take us home.  
  None of us are waiting for anything worthwhile  
  because nothing that we could ever desire  
  compares to you  
  
We need you  
  desperately  
  right now  
  
Come Lord Jesus.  
  Come quickly  
  Amen and amen
