Great God,
</div>

I am reminded what Christ declared:  
You alone are good.

You are the source of all good  
but my heart flees and wanders from you

But in your Word,  
	you declared me holy  
	because you are holy.  
	you declared me righteous  
	because Christ is righteous  
	you declared me justified  
	because you alone justified.

Then because of who You are,  
	I am awashed in your grace upon grace  
	wake up to new mercies every morning  
	abounded in your steadfast love.

I praise you for your goodness.

I praise you  
    because you define what good is  
    and we do not.

Amen
