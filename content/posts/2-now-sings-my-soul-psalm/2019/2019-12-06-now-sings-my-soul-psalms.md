<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Ascended God</div>
&nbsp;
All of Creation is yours.
  It belongs to you,
  And you rule overall.

Yet, despite my own wickedness,
  and corruption
  you sought me.
  You would even descend to become man.
  So that in you,
  you would be my righteousness.

You are the Worthy Lamb who was slain.
  Only you, my Lord, can open the gates of heaven.
  Only you, Jesus, can set the captives free.
  Only you, my Redeemer, saved a sinner like me.

I will worship you alone
  for salvation belongs to you alone
  for you are the mighty one who saves.

Who are you, my Lord?
  You are the King of glory
  Forevermore.

Amen.

</pre>
