```text
You are my Lord,
	the defender of my heart
	the rescuer of my joy
	the protector of my life.

The world, life, Satan, and sin,
	might circle me
	might entrap me
	might try to take my life.

But you, O Lord, are my strength and shield.
	my ever present help
	my healing in my gaping wounds.

I do not be so presumptuous
	that I have anything good before you
	that my heart is upright in your presence
	that any of my deeds are good for you.

You are the one who set His affections upon me
	the one whose hands grabbed me
	the one whose strength pulled me close
	the one whose love will never let me go.

Be thou my righteousness forever.
	It is only you that I trust.

```
