```text
You were mindful of me,
  before the foundations of the world
  were formed by you.

You did not merely saw,
  but you knew me intimately
  from the inside out.

You knew that my heart
  was desperately sick
  filled with sin
  and far from you.

Yet, I was formed by your loving hands
  inside my mother's womb.
  You have been my Lord
  since I have been at my mother's breast.

I was a beast before you.
  I defiled your holy name.
  I made war with your throne.
  I bastardized your saving grace.

Nonetheless, you held me in your hands,
  you alone rerouted my destiny.

You've set your Son
  to live
  to die
  to rise
  to ascend to glory
  so that I would be saved
  perfectly
  completely
  totally
  infinitely.

Once I saw your glory
  I would have been content
  to be a day in your house
  a post at your door
  to eat crumbs from your table
  to do as you command 
  because from everlasting
  to everlasting
  you are God,

But you were never content nor satisfied
  unless I rest upon your chest
  to rejoice in your glory
  to dance in your joy
  to lie still in your peace
  to live in your power.

And so you brought me in,
  gave me your Son's own robe
  signet upon my finger
  gospel upon my feet
  seal upon my heart
  a seat at your table
  a place in your heart
  a whisper in my ear
  in your home.

Because my God,
  you are my home.
  Where you lead me,
  I will follow.
  Because it is there,
  I will be home with you.

Forever.

Amen.
```
