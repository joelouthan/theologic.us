<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Beholder of my Righteousness</div>

Countless times, I lie in wait in darkness and despair. Even when I knew you and was known by you, I have never seen such misery. It did feel as though everything was against me and I knew no wait out.

But you, O my God, did not abandoned me. You did not leave me in hell. Even when I was scared and wanted to run away, you were not like other fathers that wait for their kids to come back. You pursued me. You reached out to me. You sent your prophets to speak life into these dry, dead bones.
My Lord, I knew in part and now in whole: Salvation belongs to  you alone for you are the mighty one who saves.
I might forget sometimes but you are so good and loving to reach out again and again and call my name.
I belong to you, King Jesus.
Come rescue me.

Amen.
