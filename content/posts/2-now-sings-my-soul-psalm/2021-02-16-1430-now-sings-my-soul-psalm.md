> Psalm 46 (CSB)
For the choir director. A song of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. 

      God is our refuge and strength, 
      a helper who is always found 
      in times of trouble. 
      Therefore we will not be afraid, 
      though the earth trembles 
      and the mountains topple 
      into the depths of the seas, 
      though its water roars and foams 
      and the mountains quake with its turmoil. 
                                      Selah 

      There is a river—
      its streams delight the city of God, 
      the holy dwelling place of the Most High. 
      God is within her; she will not be toppled. 
      God will help her when the morning dawns. 
      Nations rage, kingdoms topple; 
      the earth melts when he lifts his voice. 
      The LORD of Armies is with us; 
      the God of Jacob is our stronghold. 
                                      Selah 

      Come, see the works of the LORD, 
      who brings devastation on the earth. 
      He makes wars cease throughout the earth. 
      He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces; 
      he sets wagons ablaze. 
      “Stop fighting, and know that I am God, 
      exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth.” 
      The LORD of Armies is with us; 
      the God of Jacob is our stronghold. 
                                      Selah
