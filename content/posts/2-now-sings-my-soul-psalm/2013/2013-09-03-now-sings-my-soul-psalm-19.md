  My God,
</div>
&nbsp;

Yet, you transported from the spiritual to the material. You cut across space and time. You _personally_ opened my eyes, gave words for my throat, opened my eyes, filled my heart, and gave me understanding so that I may know you. You gave me rest for my soul, removed the curse from my tongue, made me your son and you glorified me.

You called out to me so that I might have life. You spoke to me because I am your friend. You whisper to me because you are always near to me.

Your words are without comparison. There is no other word that actually raised me from the dead. There is no other name by which I am saved. There is no other for you alone have the words to eternal life.

My Lord and God. My Savior. My Redeemer. My Father. My Christ. My Spirit.

My words still fall short. My heart is still so weak. But what little life I have and with what few words IÂ  can say, let them be my worship to you.

I love you, Lord. With all that I am, I will forever bless your holy name.

Amen.
