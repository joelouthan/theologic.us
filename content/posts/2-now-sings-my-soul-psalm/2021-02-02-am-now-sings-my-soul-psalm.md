My Only Gift of Righteousness
</div>
&nbsp;

All of my days  
  were filled with evil  
  treason  
  unholiness  
  vile  
  and dread before you.  
  
I was once  
  foolish  
  disobedient  
  led astray  
  a slave to various passions  
  and pleasures  
  passing my days in malice  
  and envy  
  hated by others  
  and hating others.  
  
But when you appeared,  
  O Lord  
  you brought your goodness  
  and loving kindness  
  and you saved me  
  Not because of anything I have ever done  
  or will ever do  
  but only because of your great mercy  
  and you washed me  
  my giving me a clean heart  
  and filling me richly  
  with your Holy Spirit.  
  
And now I am justified  
  by your grace  
  and now I am heir  
  because you are only hope  
  for eternal life.  
  
Be thou my vision  
  forever.  
  
Amen.
