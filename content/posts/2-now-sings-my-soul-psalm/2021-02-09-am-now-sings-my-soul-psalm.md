Lord of All
</div>
    You called upon me
      and I am your servant
      and I heard your voice

    I will wait upon you
      to give me the command
      to preaching your good news
      to the lost
      the lonely
      the widowed
      the orphan
      the prisoner

    I have waited for years
      and I will wait
      until you shower me with grace
      until you fill me with your Spirit
      like you did with your Son
      and you open my mouth
      they will not hear my voice
      nor will they hear my words
      they will hear you
      calling to them
      speaking to them
      raising the name of your Son
      Jesus Christ
      far above their sin and idols
      and draw everyone to you

    So until that faithful day
      when you judged me faithful
      and appointed to your service
      I will sit still
      and wait upon the Lord
      I will meditate on your precious love
      I will praying and seek your face
      I will rejoice and be glad in you

    I will praise your holy name
      forever and ever

    Amen
