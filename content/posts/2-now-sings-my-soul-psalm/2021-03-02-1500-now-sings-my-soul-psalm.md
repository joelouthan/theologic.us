```text> Psalm 58 (CSB)
For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David.
      Do you really speak righteously, you mighty ones? 
      Do you judge people fairly? 
      No, you practice injustice in your hearts; 
      with your hands you weigh out violence in the land.
      The wicked go astray from the womb; 
      liars wander about from birth. 
      They have venom like the venom of a snake, 
      like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears, 
      that does not listen to the sound of the charmers 
      who skillfully weave spells.
      God, knock the teeth out of their mouths; 
      LORD, tear out the young lions’ fangs. 
      May they vanish like water that flows by; 
      may they aim their blunted arrows. 
      Like a slug that moves along in slime, 
      like a woman’s miscarried child, 
      may they not see the sun.
      Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns—
      whether green or burning—
      he will sweep them away. 
      The righteous one will rejoice 
      when he sees the retribution; 
      he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
      Then people will say, 
      “Yes, there is a reward for the righteous! 
      There is a God who judges on earth!”
