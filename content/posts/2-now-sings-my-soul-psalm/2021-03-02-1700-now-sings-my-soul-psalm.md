> Psalm 59 (CSB)
For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. When Saul sent agents to watch the house and kill him. 

      Rescue me from my enemies, my God; 
      protect me from those who rise up against me. 
      Rescue me from evildoers, 
      and save me from men of bloodshed. 
      Because look, LORD, they set an ambush for me. 
      Powerful men attack me, 
      but not because of any sin or rebellion of mine. 
      For no fault of mine, 
      they run and take up a position. 
      Awake to help me, and take notice. 
      LORD God of Armies, you are the God of Israel. 
      Rise up to punish all the nations; 
      do not show favor to any wicked traitors. 
                                      Selah 

      They return at evening, snarling like dogs 
      and prowling around the city. 
      Look, they spew from their mouths—
      sharp words from their lips. 
      “For who,” they say, “will hear?” 
      But you laugh at them, LORD; 
      you ridicule all the nations. 
      I will keep watch for you, my strength, 
      because God is my stronghold. 
      My faithful God will come to meet me; 
      God will let me look down on my adversaries. 

      Do not kill them; otherwise, my people will forget. 
      By your power, make them homeless wanderers 
      and bring them down, 
      Lord, our shield. 
      For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, 
      let them be caught in their pride. 
      They utter curses and lies. 
      Consume them in fury; 
      consume them until they are gone. 
      Then people will know throughout the earth 
      that God rules over Jacob. 
                                      Selah 

      And they return at evening, snarling like dogs 
      and prowling around the city. 
      They scavenge for food; 
      they growl if they are not satisfied. 

      But I will sing of your strength 
      and will joyfully proclaim 
      your faithful love in the morning. 
      For you have been a stronghold for me, 
      a refuge in my day of trouble. 
      To you, my strength, I sing praises, 
      because God is my stronghold—
      my faithful God.
