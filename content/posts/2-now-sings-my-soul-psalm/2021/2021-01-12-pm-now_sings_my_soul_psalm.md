The Only Holder of My Heart
</div>

I have one prayer:  
  give me your heart.  
  for mine is frail and weak  
  and corrupted with sin.  
  it is made of stone  
  and gives me no life  
  it gives wickedness  
  and seeks to only destroy me.  
  
If I had your heart,  
  surely I will live  
  surely I will be in your grace  
  surely I will give others your grace  
  I will see others in the a new light  
  that you love them with all of your heart  
  and your desire was to save them  
  
Grant me a new heart, O Lord  
  then my desires will not be for this world  
  but for they will be for you alone.  
  
Be my love.  
  
Be my joy.  
  
Be my king.  
  
You are my God.  
  
I love you.  
  
Amen.
