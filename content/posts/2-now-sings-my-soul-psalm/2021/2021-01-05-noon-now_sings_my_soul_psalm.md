My Only Steadfast Love
</div>

```text

```I love you, Lord
  but only for a little while.
I have known you for most of my life
  but loved you just a little.

I have seen your love for me
  started with my grandmother
  and then my mom
My family is wicked and deceived
  and I had no inheritance.
I was introduced to the revolting evil
  at an age when I should have not known
  and that sin
  quickly overcame my heart
  and infected my soul.

The devil had me early
  and I kept trying to end my life.

But you alone
  preserved my life
  when I was treasonous against you
  gave me grace
  when I was a sinner all the more
  saved me from the utmost
  when I was deserving of wrath
  gifted me your heart
  in exchange for my concrete
  gave me your Son
  in exchange for my sin
  gave me your Spirit
  so I will be marked as your son
  forever.

My God,
  your love as always been on my life
  and I see it now
  preserve me
  keep me in your hands
  and never let me go.

I love you Lord
  increase my heart and affections
  towards you.

Amen.
