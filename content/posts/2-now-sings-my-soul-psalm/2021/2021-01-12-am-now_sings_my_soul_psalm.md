What is our lives, O Lord  
  that we would be counted as precious  
  that you would be mindful of us  
  that you would set your affections upon us  
  that you would give your grace to us  
  and you would want to cherish us?  
  
But Lord,  
  we are here for a moment  
  our lives are but a blink  
  your word says,  
  like dew on grass  
  until the early morning sun  
  scorches the fields  
  and burns us all away.  
  
Lord,  
  keep my mind on these things  
  that what I might do here  
  will give you eternal glory.  
  
Let wait upon your words  
  so I might only prophesy  
  and build up your church.  
  
Let my hands and feet  
  run after  
  those in need  
  and serve according to your will.  
  
Let me only herald  
  the eternal kingdom  
  of the Son of David  
  and evangelize till the end of the earth  
  "The Kingdom of God is here!"  
  
Help me not waste one second of my life  
  but give you eternal glory.  
  
I pray this in your Son's precious and holy name forever.  
  
Amen.
