My One Joy
</div>
&nbsp;

I write with my words  
  all the time  
  that these people who have warred against me  
  when they have sought to end my life  
  when they have chipped away at my heart  
  they are not my enemies  
  but they have been captured by the Enemy.  
  
I know this truly  
  but I cannot help to feel the pain  
  from the wounds they have left.  
  
My God,  
  you have granted me repentance  
  when I have sinned against you   
  and you were quick to forgive me.  
  
Grant me forgiveness  
  O Lord  
  to give to them  
  and would you save them, O God?  
  you are the only God  
  who is mighty to save.  
  
But if it be your will  
  not to save them to you,  
  then I pray  
  as your Son prayed  
  "Lord, forgive them  
  for they do not know what they do."  
  They have hurt me  
  but you can forgive them  
  and not punish them  
  because I am no longer identify with those pains  
  because I am only identify  
  with the life,  
  death  
  resurrection  
  and ascension   
  of my only, only Lord Jesus Christ  
  who lived  
  and died for me.  
  
Praise be your holy name forever.  
  
Amen.
