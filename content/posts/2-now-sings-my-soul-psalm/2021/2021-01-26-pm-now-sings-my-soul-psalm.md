My One Avenger
</div>

When I am hurt  
  when people hurt me  
  when they attack me  
  when they do their worse.  
  
Help me to take no offense  
  to take my pain to you, O God  
  because on your Son  
  is all of my sin  
  treason  
  disease  
  pain  
  and suffering  
  That belongs to you.  
  
I will no longer live   
  on offense  
  by angry  
  by destruction  
  by pain  
  bv sin  
  because you have called me to live in your Son alone  
  
Be my love, O Lord.  
  
I love you.  
  
Amen
