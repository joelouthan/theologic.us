My Only God
</div>

I repent  
  of a life that exacted  
  vengeance for my wounds  
  revenge for my pain  
  justice for wrongs against me.  
  
I repent for being wrathful.  
  
You, O Lord, are the ONLY being  
  deserving of justice  
  because you have been wronged  
  deserving of vengeance  
  because you have been hurt  
  wrathful  
  because you are jealous for me.  
  
Lord, I am repenting  
  of when I thought I was you.  
  
Beat this out of me  
  make me your servant  
  keep me as your friend  
  love me as your lover  
  Be my Lord and my God forever.  
  
Amen.
