```text> Psalm 60 (CSB)
For the choir director: according to “The Lily of Testimony.” A Miktam of David for teaching. When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in Salt Valley, killing twelve thousand.
      God, you have rejected us; 
      you have broken us down; 
      you have been angry. Restore us! 
      You have shaken the land and split it open. 
      Heal its fissures, for it shudders. 
      You have made your people suffer hardship; 
      you have given us wine to drink 
      that made us stagger. 
      You have given a signal flag to those who fear you, 
      so that they can flee before the archers. 
                                      Selah 
      Save with your right hand, and answer me, 
      so that those you love may be rescued.
      God has spoken in his sanctuary: 
      “I will celebrate! 
      I will divide up Shechem. 
      I will apportion the Valley of Succoth. 
      Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, 
      and Ephraim is my helmet; 
      Judah is my scepter. 
      Moab is my washbasin. 
      I throw my sandal on Edom; 
      I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
      Who will bring me to the fortified city? 
      Who will lead me to Edom? 
      God, haven’t you rejected us? 
      God, you do not march out with our armies. 
      Give us aid against the foe, 
      for human help is worthless. 
      With God we will perform valiantly; 
      he will trample our foes.
