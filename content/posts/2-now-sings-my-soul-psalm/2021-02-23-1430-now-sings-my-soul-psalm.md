> Psalm 52 (CSB)
For the choir director. A Maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite went and reported to Saul, telling him, “David went to Ahimelech’s house.” 

      Why boast about evil, you hero! 
      God’s faithful love is constant. 
      Like a sharpened razor, 
      your tongue devises destruction, 
      working treachery. 
      You love evil instead of good, 
      lying instead of speaking truthfully. 
                                      Selah 
      You love any words that destroy, 
      you treacherous tongue! 
      This is why God will bring you down forever. 
      He will take you, ripping you out of your tent; 
      he will uproot you from the land of the living. 
                                      Selah 
      The righteous will see and fear, 
      and they will derisively say about that hero, 
      “Here is the man 
      who would not make God his refuge, 
      but trusted in the abundance of his riches, 
      taking refuge in his destructive behavior.” 

      But I am like a flourishing olive tree 
      in the house of God; 
      I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever. 
      I will praise you forever for what you have done. 
      In the presence of your faithful people, 
      I will put my hope in your name, for it is good.
