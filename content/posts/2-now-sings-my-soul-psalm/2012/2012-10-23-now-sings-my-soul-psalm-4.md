  Dear God,
</div>
&nbsp;

Help!

You have helped me in the past and this time I still need you.

I have dismissed all the lies around me.

I still need you.
I still need your love.
I still need your mercy.
I still need your grace.

Give me your hand.
I need to feel your embrace.
I need to feel your warmth.
I know you are always with me.

Right now, I will lay in peace.

Because you are with me.

Selah.
