My Only Avenger,
</div>

When will I know  
  when those who would cause me harm  
  have hurt me  
  betrayed me  
  abandoned me  
  and discard me  
  that I am sorrowful for that hurt  
  and I grieve  
  and I am angry for what was done  
  because I have been hurt  
  
But for most of my life  
  I have let that fester into  
  rage  
  vengeance  
  and wrath  
  
It has taken me all of my life  
  to know  
  that rage is a sin  
  vengeance belongs to you, O Lord  
  and you alone are deserving of wrath  
  
But here is the key  
  in you great love  
  you sent your Son  
  so that for your people  
  for the salvation of those you have elected  
  you pour your wrath  
  not on us  
  but on your Son  
  because he is the Worthy Lamb that was slain  
  holy holy holy is he  
  
Cleansed my heart  
  of my wickedness  
  in thinking I am God  
  I am not Never will I be you  
  
Save us  
  and keep us in your mercy  
  shower us with grace  
  and give us your steadfast love  
  for all of our days  
  
I love you Lord  
  thank you for saving me  
  
Save those whom I know and care for and love  
  
Amen
