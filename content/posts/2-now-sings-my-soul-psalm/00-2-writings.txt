<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My God
</div>
 
```text
I cannot fall back into wickedness
I cannot sin again
I cannot be apart from you
I cannot

I don't want to live
If I cannot be in your presence
You life is my life
And I choose not to live without you.

Any sin left on my heart
I need you wash it away
Bring it up
Give me the gift of repentance
So I can turn away
And turn to you.

Do this every moment of my life
I have done everything
The world
My friends
Work
Satan
Demons
And sin
Told me to go after
And all of it is crap
I find it wanting
It is lacking

You have been the only thing
That I have ever experienced
That has given me perfection
Perfect in love
Grace
mercy

You are better
You are more
You are righteous
You are far above all of my gods.

I hate this world
And I want nothing from it.

Take me home.
Cleansed me of sin
And take me home
You are so good
And there is nothing left here for me.

Amen.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The Judge of My Heart
</div>
 
```text
Everything that I have
And all that I got
It is in you.

I have nowhere else to go
And no one else to turn to
You are my righteousness
In you, I will trust.

I will bless your name forever 
I will worship your name on high
I will proclaim your word to everyone
I will preach your gospel to the end
I will love you forever
I will fear you for my life
I will be still
And know you are my God.

Amen.

## Psalm 53
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The One Invite to the Foolish
</div>

```text
My presence
My life
My words
My actions
Boldly proclaim,
"There is no God!"

I sinned when I wanted
And never repented
No intention of
Because I thought I was be fulfilled
I thought porn was caring for me
I thought lust was healing me.

But my sins
Chew on my bones
And gnawed on my flesh
And I was immune to the pain
And could not see what it was doing.

I was dead in my trespasses
and sins
Because I walked according
To the ways of this world,
According to every whim of Satan
Disobeying you with every breath of my life
I dwelled in my own fleshly desires
I did what was right in my own eyes
Disobeying you
And sitting under your wrath.

But you,
O God
Forever rich in mercy
Because of your great love for me
Took me from death
To life with your Son
Even when I was dead.

I am saved by grace!

You raised me up with Christ
So why?
So that you can display
Your immeasurable riches of your grace
Through the kindness of your Son

I was saved by grace through faith
Nothing that I am
Nothing I have ever did
Nothing that I can ever do
Because you gave me everything
Because you gave me your Son

I will boast in nothing less
Then Jesus' blood and righteousness.

Everything that I am
I am your work and poem.

Give me your Spirit
Write your word upon my heart
Dwell in my heart
And go and send me.

## Psalm 54
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The Only Name By Which I Am Saved
</div>
 
```text
I have seen so many evils in my life
And I thought I had so many enemies
Because they have wounded me
And attempted to destroy me.

I have come close to the edge of death
Because I was desperate for your love
And I cannot bear to live one more moment
Under persecution and torment.

I was already weak.
The schemes of the devil?
They worked.
I was defeated.
And I was no more.

But in whatever way
I cannot understand
You saved me
And you saved me time and time again
No matter how far I stray
No matter if I was faithful
You came and grabbed me and brough me close.

What about that time
When you gave me your peace?
How did I react?
I fled full long into sin
I gave over to lust and temptation
I was seeking nothing from you
Because I thought I had lost everything
I was too blinded
To see 
That no matter what I have lost
Even my life
I have everything
Because I have you
You are the holy one of God
Christ Jesus my Lord
I don't need to turn anywhere else
I don't need to go anywhere else
I have you.

You are my All-in-all.

Be my loving God.

Have mercy on me.

Thank you for saving me
And making me your Son.

Amen.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Prayer
</div>

```text
I don't pretend to understand
Or can even teach
Or comprehend
Why you would answer my prayers.

But just like those in the Bible,
I called on you
And you answered
And you rescued me.

Sometimes I will pray
And you will not answer my questions
I have taken that to mean
I will wait upon the Lord
Because you alone are my refuge and strength
My portion
My help in my very hour of need.

I have seen the faith of my grandmother
Who prayed for you to save my dad
And you did!

And I have seen my grandmother
Pray for you to save me
and you did!

I know you alone are mighty to save
Because salvation belongs to you.

Save me
Save my children
Save my household
Save their households

Lord,

Save us all
So that together
We can worship you.

Be my God.

Amen.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Fear
</div>
 
```text
I have spent all of my life
Being scared
Being fearful of man
And worrying about what did they think of me

My eyes
were never
Where they should have been
They should have been fixated 
On the only one
Who answers my cries
quiets my soul
Cares for my heart
Loves me till the end
And brings me all the way home.

Breath life into me
When I turn away
And start to be anxious and fearing man
Man cannot save me
Man cannot soothe me
Man cannot save my soul
Only you, my Lord
Can save me
And love me
And heal me.

Be with me.

Amen.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Grace
</div>
 
```text
I have been surrounded by evil
Left exposed
And vulnerable
To Satan and Demons
Who feed upon my flesh
And leave me to perish.

My God
How did you know
Where I needed help
How could you love 
Someone like me
I have been unloved and unwanted
All of my life
But you came along
And brought me to you
And kept me in your heart.

I have fought with you
But you stayed with me
I have warred against you
And you love me regardless
I have ran away
Yet you were there to rescue me
All the days of my life.

You have always been with me
From my mother's womb
Till I see you.

You are forever
My Lord and King.

Amen.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Identity
</div>
 
```text
No matter what has happened to me
For I have been
molested
raped
left to starve
kidnapped
Held for hostage
Homeless
Loveless
Orphan
Lost
Divorced
Twice
Lost my kids
Lost my jobs
Lost my friends
And my homes.

I am sinner
filled with lust
worked in porn
stolen
cheated
lied
lazy
full of rage
Filled with wrath
Filled with pride
Hater of everyone
Hater of women
Hater of self.

Yet,
I am not those things.
Because you saw me 
Before time began
And you loved me
And you set your affections 
Upon me
And because you sent your Son
Who lived for me
Who bled, hung, and died for me
Who ascended to your right hand for me
Who sent His Spirit for me.

You are my identity.
I identified with you.

Nothing I have done
Or anything that has happened to me
Not my circumstances
Nor my deeds
just you
My Lord and my King.

Amen.
```

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Strength
</div>
 
```text
The battles I have seen
The bloodshed upon my hands
The hurt I have caused
The wounds I have made
Was all of my actions.

I have been hurt too
And that does not make it right

I am sorry Lord
For the hurt I have caused.

Will you save me?

Will you give me a tender heart
To forgive others
And love others
And to seek reconcilation
and help heal others?

I am so sorry Lord
For all of my sins.

Make me like your Son
And turn my heart towards you.

Amen.
