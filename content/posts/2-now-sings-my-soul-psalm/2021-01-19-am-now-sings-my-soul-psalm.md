My One Commitment
</div>

    I love you Lord
      and you are my heart's desire
      for all of my days
      I want to be by your side
      and dwell with you
      and waste my days with you
      because you are the Lord of my life
      and the love of my heart.

    How amazing
      that you would look upon
      my sinful heart
      and thought of love at first sight
      there is none like you
      there is none beside you
      I stake all of my hope and trust in you
      you are my God and my Lord forever
      you are the center and totality of my heart
      you are my will and my desire.

    God,
      keep me close
      never let me go
      don't loosen your grip on me
      because I couldn't stand it
      and I rather die
      then to be apart from you.
      Because if I do,
      then I will be with you.

    Be my God.
      Be my sweetest affections
      and my deepest joy
      and my fieriest passions.

    I will praise you.

    Amen.
