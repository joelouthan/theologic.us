```text> Psalm 55 (CSB)
For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David.
      God, listen to my prayer 
      and do not hide from my plea for help. 
      Pay attention to me and answer me. 
      I am restless and in turmoil with my complaint, 
      because of the enemy’s words, 
      because of the pressure of the wicked. 
      For they bring down disaster on me 
      and harass me in anger.
      My heart shudders within me; 
      terrors of death sweep over me. 
      Fear and trembling grip me; 
      horror has overwhelmed me. 
      I said, “If only I had wings like a dove! 
      I would fly away and find rest. 
      How far away I would flee; 
      I would stay in the wilderness. 
                                      Selah 
      I would hurry to my shelter 
      from the raging wind and the storm.”
      Lord, confuse and confound their speech, 
      for I see violence and strife in the city; 
      day and night they make the rounds on its walls. 
      Crime and trouble are within it; 
      destruction is inside it; 
      oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace.
      Now it is not an enemy who insults me—
      otherwise I could bear it; 
      it is not a foe who rises up against me—
      otherwise I could hide from him. 
      But it is you, a man who is my peer, 
      my companion and good friend! 
      We used to have close fellowship; 
      we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
      Let death take them by surprise; 
      let them go down to Sheol alive, 
      because evil is in their homes and within them. 
      But I call to God, 
      and the LORD will save me. 
      I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, 
      and he hears my voice. 
      Though many are against me, 
      he will redeem me from my battle unharmed. 
      God, the one enthroned from long ago, 
      will hear and will humiliate them 
                                      Selah 
      because they do not change 
      and do not fear God.
      My friend acts violently 
      against those at peace with him; 
      he violates his covenant. 
      His buttery words are smooth, 
      but war is in his heart. 
      His words are softer than oil, 
      but they are drawn swords.
      Cast your burden on the LORD, 
      and he will sustain you; 
      he will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
      God, you will bring them down 
      to the Pit of destruction; 
      men of bloodshed and treachery 
      will not live out half their days. 
      But I will trust in you.
