&nbsp;
What does your word say?
  Your word goes out
  and does it sets to accomplishes
  and never returns void?

You have made promises
  to Adam
  to Noah
  to Abraham
  to David
  and to all the prophets

That you will send 
  the One who would crush the head of the serpent
  that is Jesus Christ
  the Savior of his people
  the Redeemer of our sins
  the Messiah of the nations
  the Conquerer of Satan
  the Vanquisher of demons
  the Wrath-filler of hell
  the Glory of the cosmos

And this is perfectly true
  and now you have captured our hearts.

Be exalted, O God,
  higher and higher.
</pre>
