```text
How long, O Lord,
   when I have not confess to you
   when I have spoken of my evil
   when I thought, "The Lord forgives"
   and I no longer will be burdened with you.
 
But burden with my wickedness, I was.
   My pretend ignorance failed me
   My own heart betrays me.
   and I was crushed under my iniquity
   and I was suppressed by my unrighteousness.
 
But you have sent your Son
   to change my mind
   to speak life into my dead flesh
   to exchange my rock heart for your soft heart
   to borne my grief
   to carry my sorrow
   to be stricken for me
   to be smitten for me
   to be afflicted for me
   and pierced for my transgression
   and crushed for my iniquity.
   to be my righteousness forever.
 
Take my sin
   my back-breaking yoke
   my strength-sapping burden
   the best that I can ever do.
 
And give me your Son
   so I dwell in your presence
   and be free to love and obey you
   all of my days
   forever.
 
Amen.

```
