<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sovereign</div>
We have made the grandest plans
  devised the biggest schemes
  and planned our legacy
  that we are so certain that lives on.

But you are alone
  rule and reign over all of creation
  sets up and takes down kings
  determines the times and boundaries of our dwelling

Because you are not merely in the present
  but also currently in the past
  because you are from everlasting to everlasting
  and you are currently in the future
  because you are the God who is there.

Therefore
  you do not merely do something
  speaking something
  think something
  and cause a chain reaction
  But you are the chain
  and the reaction
  of everything.

You rule and reign 
  over all creation
  time
  space
  the material
  and the spiritual

No one is like you.
</pre>
