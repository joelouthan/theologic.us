<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Blessed Redeemer,</div>
Who is like you,
    splendid in majesty
    high and exalted
    wonderful and amazing
    beautiful and all-together lovely.

So I will sing this song,
    with all of my days
    because you are my portion
    and you loved me since forever.

How many times have you rescued me
    from the pit of despair
    from the darkness of hell
    from the knife edge of death?

I know not the countless times.

But you are faithful in all of your ways,
    perfect
    true
    blessed
    good
    righteous

And I know you will rescue me countless times more.

I praise you forever I will praise you.

Forever I will sing
    you are my beauty
    you are my strength

And I will sing.


</pre>
