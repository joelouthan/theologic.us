<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Strength of My Heart</div>
&nbsp;
My Lord,
	if it be your will
	and under your grace alone,
	allow me your humble servant
	and your little child
	to preach your good news to the whole world.

You are my Love and my Heart,
	there is none like you.
	You are Savior of the world,
	there is none like you.
	You are more beautiful,
	and the fairest of 10,000
	there is none like you.
	
You are good,
	perfectly holy
	and altogether lovely.
	
Be my safe place
	be my refuge
	be my vision
	be my shield.
	
You are my Savior
	and the love of my life
	forever.
	
Amen.
</pre>
