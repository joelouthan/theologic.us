<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My God</div>
&nbsp;
My days here are just for a moment,
	and you have number them all.
	My life remains in your hands,
	only you know my beginning and end.
	
Too many times,
	I have cried out
	to end my life here
	so you can bring me home.
	So much misery
	and calamity
	and confusion
	when all I wanted
	was peace beyond all understanding.
	
But you are the Lord my God,
	who is from everlasting to everlasting,
	who calls anything into existence,
	who predestines us to life,
	who creates the vessels made for destruction.
	
And yet, you sent your Son,
	who became flesh,
	who dwelt among us.
	And now we have seen God,
	the only God,
	who was at the Father's side,
	because you have made Him know.
	
And now from his fullness,
	I dwell in grace upon grace.
	Lord, you dictate my life.
	You tell me
	if I will see your glory.
	Be exalted in my life,
	today.
	
Amen.
