<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Keeper of my heart</div>
&nbsp;
I have spent all of my days
  wandering from your presence
  searching for new idols
  finding new ways to sin against you

And my life aches and groans in pain,
  not only of the sin against me
  but mostly because of my own sin.

Lord, hear my cries
  do not abandon me
  do not let me see evil
  do not take your Spirit from me

Lord, I have no idea of what youâ€™ve called me
  but it will not be easy
  and it will take all of your grace
  and you must give me your heart and Spirit
  for me to do your will. 

But I love you Lord
 and I cry out loud
 to worship and praise your holy name. 
 My soul and heart rejoices. 
 May everything in me
 and all that I have 
 bless your holy name
 Forever. 

Amen.
