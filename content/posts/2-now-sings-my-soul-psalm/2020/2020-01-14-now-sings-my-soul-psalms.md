<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O Lord</div>

My enemies have been numerous,
	and they attack me relentless.


They do not rest when I am sleeping,
	they even attack me in my dreams.

My scars run deep,
	my bones break.
	
But you, O Lord, are my healer and my restorer.
	You sent your Son
	to care for the sick and wounded.
	Be attentive to my pain
	and I will rejoice before you.
	
You are the sweet love of my life forever.

Amen.



</pre>
