```text
The galaxies fall right into the palm of your hand,
  the universe are in your grasp
  the stars are named by you
  Jupiter is but a little toy to you
  the sun is pinched between your finger and thumb

We have been here for the length of the creation
  and yet we do not know the depths of the oceans
  we are powerless to gather up a ocean wave

But you, my Lord,
  gathered all the material plane
  at your mere fingertips.

And you alone, my Lord,
  gathered my stony heart
  tossed to the infinite east-west
  Grabbed into your chest
  ripped your heart out
  by sending your Son
  to live and die
  and place that love
  placed into my chest
  just to give me life.

Blessed be your wonderful name.
```
