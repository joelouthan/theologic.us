<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Only Savior</div>
&nbsp;
Who is like you, God?
	and who compares to you?

You alone are worthy
	of honor
	of praise
	of worship for all of my days.
The world critiques
	ridicules
	slams
	kills
	destroys.
But you are the only Savior,
	who pulls me from hell
	brings me to your bosom
	and gives me peaceful rest
	because you alone are grace.
Because you have declared me to be your child,
	do not ignore me.
	Hear my cries!
	Make me like you!
	Make me righteous like you!
	So I will never depart from you
	or you would ever depart from me.
Keep me from this world,
	from the snares of the Devil
	from the traps of Demons
	from the bowels of Sheol
	from the darkness of my heart.
Bring me to your throne,
 and judge me rightly,
 in the blood-stained robe of your only begotten Son.

Amen.
