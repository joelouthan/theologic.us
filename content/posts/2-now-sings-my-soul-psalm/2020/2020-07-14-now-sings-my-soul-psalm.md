&nbsp;
My Lord,
	my life bears witness
	that you alone protect me
	shield me
	provide for me
	and place your loving arms
	wrapped around me.

You hold me like a child,
	for I am just as vulnerable
	and would be devoured by dogs
	if it was not for you.
	
I praise your holy name
	for you are Lord Most High.
	So be exalted
	in my life
	and with my words.
	
Thank you for sparing me
 and thank you for saving my life
 Thank you for shielding me
 from the world
 from sin
 from Satan and his demons
 and sparing me from hell
 and protecting me
 from your just wrath.

Have mercy on me,
	for all of my days
	and bring me home quickly
	so I can stare into your eyes
	for all of eternity.
	
Amen.
</pre>
