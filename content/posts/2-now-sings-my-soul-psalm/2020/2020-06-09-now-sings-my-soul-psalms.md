<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Only Redeemer</div>
Who is like you, God?

And who would compare to you?

You are my everything

And since birth, you have protected me
	you have guided me
	even when I wanted to run away
	you have always brought be back home.

**You have not abandoned me to hell**
	even when the world the discarded me as trash
	and everybody has despised me
	and Satan has come to destroyed me
	and his demons keep me in disarray
	and my own sin defiles me

But you, O Lord, are my heart's desire
	and I long to worship you.

Be with me.

Declare me to the holy
	and do not let me see corruption.

For you have shown me
	guided me
	and walked with me
	on Your path
	and now I am fully alive.

One blessed day,
	I will hold your face in my hands
	and kiss you with a thousand kisses
	and you will fill me with such great joy
	and I will sit at your right hand
	and be eternally
	completely
	perfectly
	blessed
	forevermore.

</pre>
