<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O LORD my God,</div>

```text
I sing praises to your name,
  for you are worthy
  and worthy to be praised.

I have cried for help,
  too many times to recall
  How many times have you responded?
  All of them plus one more.

I know I am with you,
  and because of that
  I am being healed by your loving grace
  My soul has been afflicted
  My heart has been scorched
  My body has been abused
  But you are my everlasting joy
  and the healer of all iniquity and sin.

For the sin that has affected me,
  you have picked me up
  set me on your Rock
  cleansed my wounds
  gave me a new heart
  with your desires
  and called me your own.

For all of my treacherous sins,
  you set your affections upon me
  you chased after me with your full Might
  and because you loved me so much
  you sent your Son
  to live for me
  to die in my place
  to resurrect so that I would be fully alive
  and then rose to glory
  All because you are glorious.

There is none like you.
```
