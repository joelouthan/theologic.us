<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Steadfast Lover</div>
Who is like you, my Lord,
	clothed in majesty
	and who alone is good.

When I have realized
 the extent of my pain
 the depths of my sin
 the torment of my evil soul
 the wickedness of the Devil
 and the infection of my heart.

I called upon you
	and swiftly, you answered me.
	"Here I am!"
	and in your gentleness
	and loving kindness
	and grace abounding
  saved me to yourself.

Be exalted.

My Lord, be exalted.

Amen.
</pre>
