<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Blessed is He
</div>
&nbsp;
With my lips
  I will speak blessings
  to my God

With my hands
  I will bless others
  for my Christ

With my feet
  I will bring peace
  for my Savior

With my mind
  I will think
  upon my Redeemer

With my strength
  I will depend
  upon the Almighty.

With my portion
  it will only come
  from my All-in-all

With my heart
  I will love
  the Lord at all times

Jesus
  the Worthy Lamb who was slain
  glorious and mighty are you
  mercy and power are at your hands
  grace and love are from your heart

Be exalted
  in everything I do
  I will worship you
  forever I will
  you alone are my God.
</pre>
