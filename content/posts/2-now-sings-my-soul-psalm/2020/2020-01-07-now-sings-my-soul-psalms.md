<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O Lord</div>
&nbsp;

Every single adult who were suppose to love me and care for me
	did not.

My father raped me.
My mother abandoned me.
My grandmother threw me to the wolves.
My step-mother neglected and beat me.

But you, O Lord, have never stopped loving me,
	even when everybody else has.

You have called me into this world,
	only to glorify you.

You have declared that I am in the world and not of the world.
	so let the world become dark and grotesque in my eyes
	so that my eyes would stare deeply in your glorious light.

My God, save me.
	take me home
	to be with you forever.

Amen.

</pre>
