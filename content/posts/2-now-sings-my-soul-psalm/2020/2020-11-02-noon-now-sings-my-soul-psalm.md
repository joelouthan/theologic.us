To the Rock of Ages
</div>
&nbsp;
The world
  and the Prince of the Air
  and his demons
  have left me
  to rot
  to die
  to drown in the middle of the ocean
  to be consumed by the waves
  to let my soul fall into hell.

They care not for my soul,
  it does not bother them
  if I live or if I die
  It is better for them
  if I was to be destroyed.

But when the waves were about to swallow me whole
  you have come along
  an bedrock island
  raised up
  and pushes me closer to the sun
  where I can be healed by you
  rest in you
  recover in you
  be with you
  and you with me.

You alone are my strength and shield
  I will worship and rest in you.
</pre>
