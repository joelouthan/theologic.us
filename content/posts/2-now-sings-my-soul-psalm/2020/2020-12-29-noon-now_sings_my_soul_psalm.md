My Only Deliverer
</div>

    How often do I preach
      against the sin in others
      guilt deep in the hearts of men
      and as they continue to plot in vain
      as if there is no God.

    But my life
      was filled to the hilt
      with my own wickedness
      perversions that few can know
      evil that cause some to shudder
      sin that churns and burns in my
      heart
      mind
      and soul
      continuously.

    I was one of these worthless men
      that sinned all the more
      I was ill-deserving of any leniency
      I could not afford grace.

    But you O Lord
      had me in your sights
      and you had sweetest mercy for me
      and you pulled me out of hell
      and your rescued me from death
      and you loved me
      and you saved me
      and you bless me.

    My God, keep your hand on my life
      and keep turning my heart towards you.

    Amen.
