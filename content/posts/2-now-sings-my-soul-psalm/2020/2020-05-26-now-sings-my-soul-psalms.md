<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Precious Redeemer</div>
&nbsp;
I am going to worship you,
	all of my days
	for all of my life
	for all that I have.
I can declare this in boldness
	nothing of my own strength
	and I have no righteousness to speak of.
	
Because I have seen the fullness of your grace,
	and the ongoing gift of kindness
	the daily portion of mercies every morning
	and the steadfastness of your love.
	
I have failed
	but you are God.
	
Let my life and love and my words glorify you
	al of my days.

</pre>
