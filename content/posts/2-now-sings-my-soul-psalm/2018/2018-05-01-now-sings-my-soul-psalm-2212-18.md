  Dear God,
</div>
&nbsp;
My enemies are on all sides and their attacks are relentless, you are my protector.

When lions clamp down on my guts, you are the teeth-breaker and my healer.

When I am buried, you call me out of the ground.

When I was dead in my sins, you lived, died, and rose alive so that I might live.

You have never left me.

You have always been with me even when I did not know nor loved you.

You have always been there.

And I will forever worship you, my God.
