```text
You are the fountain of true life.
I am dead without you. 
  It is not that 
  I can find this water on my own.
For I am lost
  and, my soul is dried-up and dead.
I have no wisdom, 
  strength, 
  or spirit to find you.

But you, O Lord, rescued me.

You have brought me into your life 
  and in your life alone, 
  I am <em>fully</em> alive.
My soul is no longer dried in sin 
  but restored, 
  covered, 
  and filled with your forever grace.

God, please keep me close 
  so that I stay refreshed 
  and satisfied in all of life.
```
