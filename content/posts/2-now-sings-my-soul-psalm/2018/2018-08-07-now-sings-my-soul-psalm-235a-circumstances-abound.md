My God,
</div>

```text
I have been crushed and
  discarded a hundred times.
  But, I have warred against you
  thousand more.

Yet, you sent your Son to live
  and die for me.

And now I live for you.

I will never understand
  why you saved me,
  but I only know that
  because I have sin much
  You have forgiven much.

Now I know you let me sit
  at your table,
  when I should been
  condemned for treason.

You knew I was an enemy,
  and you then declared me
  as your friend.

My God, remind me always that,
  I do not do battle
  against prisoners of war,
  but against the rulers
  who imprisoned them.

Give me your almighty strength,
  and your invincible armour,
  and let me help
  you set the captives free.

In your Sonâ€™s name I pray. Amen.
```
