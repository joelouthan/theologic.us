  My Worthy Lord,
</div>

Let my words and my songs be a sweetness to your ears.

For I know that you sit on the throne of our praises because you are the God who alone saves.

I know that not only are you willing and able to save, you and you alone are the only one who is mighty to save.

So I praise you with all of my breath and strength and life.

And you have commissioned me to go tell everyone everywhere of everything that you have done. That if they turn to you, you will save them, even in their deepest, darkest despair.

So I preach of you and your great gospel.

Until every knee bows and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer forever.
