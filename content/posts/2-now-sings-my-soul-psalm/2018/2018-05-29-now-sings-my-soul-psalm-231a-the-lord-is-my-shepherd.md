</pre>
You are my Good Shepherd.

You fled the ninety-nine 
    in order to come rescue me,
	when I could not possibly rescue myself.
You saved me 
    from certain damnation,
	you’ve rescued me from the slaughter.
You’ve taken all of my sin,
	and you let the wrath of Father 
	fall upon your heart
You bled out for me,
	so that I might live forever.
Lord, keep me in your care,
	I pray that you keep good shepherds 
	to care and feed me.
	none that will run away 
	at the first sight of danger
	none that will be swayed 
	to and fro by every wind of doctrine
	but stay the course because 
	you are their strength and resolve.

I praise your holy name ever.</pre>
