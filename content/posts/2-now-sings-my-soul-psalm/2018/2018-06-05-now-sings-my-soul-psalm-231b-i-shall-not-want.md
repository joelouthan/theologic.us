</pre>My Lord Above,
I thank you for your perfect provision.
You are my Good Father in heaven
    and because I am your child,
    you have always provided for me.
When I was younger, I wanted many things
	but you did not provide them.
But looking back,
	those things I wanted
	would have harmed me
	or cause me to turn away from you.
But what you have always done
	is gave something even better,
	which turned out to be actually good.
It is by your hand alone
	that I have shelter over my head,
	food in my stomach,
	water upon my dried tongue.
It is by your strength
	I am able to stand
	work
	seek out accomplishments
	which is the work you have provided
	for me to do for your glory.
But more than that,
	you are my All-in-all
	because you gave me everything
	when you gave me yourself
	in Christ Jesus my Lord
Since I have your love,
	your Son,
	your Spirit,
    you have given me so much
    that heaven and earth
    can give me no more.
I will praise you
    with every single breath you give me.
And I will love you
    with all the love you have given me.
</pre>
