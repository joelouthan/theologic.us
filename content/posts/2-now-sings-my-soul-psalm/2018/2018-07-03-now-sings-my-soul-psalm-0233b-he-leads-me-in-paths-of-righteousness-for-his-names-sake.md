>   I am often reminded of my sinful ways of the past. As the vines grew up from my heart and slowly and surely tightened around my neck as I continuously die without thought

>   But you, my God, broke the spell of the sin over my life.

>   But time after time, I see those weeds grow. I feel the cancer thriving in my heart. I sense the sin that crouches for me and waits to pierce my soul with his poison.

>   But you see it, too,

>   You come down and burn those weeds with extreme prejudice. You come in like the perfect surgeon, with a laser scalpel and burn away those cells, leaving only a soft and tender heart. You come into your pasture and violently bash in the head of the serpent with the heel of your foot.

>   You have sent your Spirit to walk, lead, and guide me through the darkest valleys. But I never fear. You are my Lord and God. Protector. Giver. Beloved.

>   I praise and adore you forever.
