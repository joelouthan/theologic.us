```text
You are the Prince of Peace. 

Where you are,
  there I find satisfaction of my wearied soul 
  and find perfect peace where I can truly rest.

Apart from you, 
  I die and I perish. 
  Away from you, 
  I am only tormented by confusion and despair. 
  Without you, 
  there is nothing 
  but destructions 
  by my own hands 
  and by everything around me.

But you, O Lord, 
  call me to enter 
  through you and abide in you. 
  Once I am in your good graces, 
  you take the back-breaking weight of sin off me 
  and place it upon you. 
  Once more, you lay your light, 
  featherweight righteousness upon me. 
  I am no longer under crushing condemnation 
  nor your furious wrath 
  but yet, 
  within the protection 
  of your great arm 
  and the coolness 
  within your great fortress, 
  that is the Rock of Ages.

Once more, 
  you are the truth. 
  While my heart strays 
  and wanders from you, 
  you are the Good Shepherd 
  who would gladly chase me down 
  and bring home over and over again. 
  Because you alone have the words of eternal life, 
  I have nowhere else to go but to come home with you.

I thank you 
  for healing my broken heart and mind. 

I thank you 
  for opening my eyes, ears, and mouth of your glory and goodness. 

I thank you 
  for giving me strength for you are Christ Jesus my Lord forever.
