<pre><blockquote>
  Who made me to differ, but thee?
  for I was no more ready to receive Christ
  than were others;
  I could not have begun to love thee hadst thou not
  first loved me,
  or been willing unless thou hadst first made me so.
  O that such a crown should fit the head of such
  a sinner!
  such high advancement be for an unfruitful
  person!
  such joys for so vile a rebel!
  Infinite wisdom cast the design of salvation
  into the mould of purchase and freedom;
  Let wrath deserved be written on the door of hell,
  But the free gift of grace on the gate of heaven.
</blockquote></pre>
