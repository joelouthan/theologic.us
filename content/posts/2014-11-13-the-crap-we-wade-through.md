With all of my struggles, I found out I was suffering from depression.

Now, by God&#8217;s strength and grace and his love alone, I have to battle this.

And I know that God will deliver me from this&#8211;just like he delivered me from death.

I pray:
  
May the LORD bless me and keep me;
  
May the LORD make his face to shine upon me and be gracious to me;
  
May the LORD lift up his countenance upon me and give me peace.

Amen.
