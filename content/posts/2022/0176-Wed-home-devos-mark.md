## The Text

><sup> 38 </sup> He also said in his teaching, “Beware of the scribes, who want to go around in long robes and who want greetings in the marketplaces, 

><sup> 39 </sup> the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets. 

><sup> 40 </sup> They devour widows’ houses and say long prayers just for show. These will receive harsher judgment.”
