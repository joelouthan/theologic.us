## The Text

>Mark 11:12-14 (CSB) 
><sup> 12 </sup> The next day when they went out from Bethany, he was hungry. 

><sup> 13 </sup> Seeing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he went to find out if there was anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season for figs. 

><sup> 14 </sup> He said to it, ‚ÄúMay no one ever eat fruit from you again!‚Äù And his disciples heard it.
