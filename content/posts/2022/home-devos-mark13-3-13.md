## The Text

>Mark 13:3–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 3 </sup> While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 

><sup> 4 </sup> “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?” 

><sup> 5 </sup> Jesus told them, “Watch out that no one deceives you. 

><sup> 6 </sup> Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many. 

><sup> 7 </sup> When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be alarmed; these things must take place, but it is not yet the end. 

><sup> 8 </sup> For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. 

><sup> 9 </sup> “But you, be on your guard! They will hand you over to local courts, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them. 

><sup> 10 </sup> And it is necessary that the gospel be preached to all nations. 

><sup> 11 </sup> So when they arrest you and hand you over, don’t worry beforehand what you will say, but say whatever is given to you at that time, for it isn’t you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 

><sup> 12 </sup> “Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. 

><sup> 13 </sup> You will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
