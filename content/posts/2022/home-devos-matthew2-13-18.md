## The Text

>Matthew 2:13–18 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up! Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.” 

><sup> 14 </sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt. 

><sup> 15 </sup> He stayed there until Herod’s death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: Out of Egypt I called my Son. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Then Herod, when he realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 

><sup> 18 </sup> A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.
