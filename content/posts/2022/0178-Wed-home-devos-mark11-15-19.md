## The Text

>Mark 11:15–19 (CSB)  
><sup> 15 </sup> They came to Jerusalem, and he went into the temple and began to throw out those buying and selling. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, 

><sup> 16 </sup> and would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple. 

><sup> 17 </sup> He was teaching them: “Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves!” 

><sup> 18 </sup> The chief priests and the scribes heard it and started looking for a way to kill him. For they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was astonished by his teaching. 

><sup> 19 </sup> Whenever evening came, they would go out of the city.
