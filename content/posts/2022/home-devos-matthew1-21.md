## The Text

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

## The Devotion

It is one thing to say Mary, who is pregnant at the time, to give birth. It is another thing to know the sex of the child--that he will be a son to Mary. Another presumptuous to tell the husband of the wife pregnant with not your kid what his name is. But the insane, crazy statement:

>She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.

See the audacity. Know the boldness. Feel the weight of this prediction.

Jesus will save his people from their sins.

>Romans 1:16 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

We want to deal with the possibilities. "Oh, I hope my son knows Jesus." "I hope my neighbor knows Christ." When in reality, our hope is in the God, whom Isaiah called, "mighty to save". Not might save--not possibility of saving but will actually save us from our sins.

Jesus Christ, Son of God who is fully God, did not come to be born of of the virgin Mary, to live the life we should have lived and died the death we should have died in the hope of a mere possibility or that you and I might say "yes" to the Almighty God of the universe.

You and I were saved by God some 2000 years ago on a cross on Calvary. And the path to that cross started in the womb of Mary, the wife of Joseph, conceived by the Holy Spirit at the decree of the sovereign grace of God the Father.

Praise be to God!
