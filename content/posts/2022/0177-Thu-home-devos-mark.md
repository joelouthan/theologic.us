## The Text

><sup> 41 </sup> Sitting across from the temple treasury, he watched how the crowd dropped money into the treasury. Many rich people were putting in large sums. 

><sup> 42 </sup> Then a poor widow came and dropped in two tiny coins worth very little. 

><sup> 43 </sup> Summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 

><sup> 44 </sup> For they all gave out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had—all she had to live on.”
