## The Text

>Mark 13:14–23 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> “When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be” (let the reader understand), “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains. 

><sup> 15 </sup> A man on the housetop must not come down or go in to get anything out of his house, 

><sup> 16 </sup> and a man in the field must not go back to get his coat. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days! 

><sup> 18 </sup> “Pray it won’t happen in winter. 

><sup> 19 </sup> For those will be days of tribulation, the kind that hasn’t been from the beginning of creation until now and never will be again. 

><sup> 20 </sup> If the Lord had not cut those days short, no one would be saved. But he cut those days short for the sake of the elect, whom he chose. 

><sup> 21 </sup> “Then if anyone tells you, ‘See, here is the Messiah! See, there!’ do not believe it. 

><sup> 22 </sup> For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the elect. 

><sup> 23 </sup> And you must watch! I have told you everything in advance.
