## The Text

><sup> 18 </sup> Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and questioned him: 

><sup> 19 </sup> “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife behind but no child, that man should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother. 

><sup> 20 </sup> There were seven brothers. The first married a woman, and dying, left no offspring. 

><sup> 21 </sup> The second also took her, and he died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. 

><sup> 22 </sup> None of the seven left offspring. Last of all, the woman died too. 

><sup> 23 </sup> In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her?” 

><sup> 24 </sup> Jesus spoke to them, “Isn’t this the reason why you’re mistaken: you don’t know the Scriptures or the power of God? 

><sup> 25 </sup> For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven. 

><sup> 26 </sup> And as for the dead being raised—haven’t you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God said to him: I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? 

><sup> 27 </sup> He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken.”
