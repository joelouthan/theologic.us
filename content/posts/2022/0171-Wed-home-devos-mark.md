## The Text

>Mark 12:1-12 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug out a pit for a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went away. 

><sup> 2 </sup> At harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers to collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from them. 

><sup> 3 </sup> But they took him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Again he sent another servant to them, and they hit him on the head and treated him shamefully. 

><sup> 5 </sup> Then he sent another, and they killed that one. He also sent many others; some they beat, and others they killed. 

><sup> 6 </sup> He still had one to send, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 

><sup> 7 </sup> But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 

><sup> 8 </sup> So they seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. 

><sup> 9 </sup> What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill the farmers and give the vineyard to others. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Haven’t you read this Scripture: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. 

><sup> 11 </sup> This came about from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes?” 

><sup> 12 </sup> They were looking for a way to arrest him but feared the crowd because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. So they left him and went away.
