## The Text

>Mark 11:27–33 (CSB)  
><sup> 27 </sup> They came again to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came 

><sup> 28 </sup> and asked him, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do these things?” 

><sup> 29 </sup> Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; then answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 

><sup> 30 </sup> Was John’s baptism from heaven or of human origin? Answer me.” 

><sup> 31 </sup> They discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 

><sup> 32 </sup> But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was truly a prophet. 

><sup> 33 </sup> So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
