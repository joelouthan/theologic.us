## The Introduction

If you pay too close attention to social media, it is quite popular to love certain parts of the Bible and then dislike certain parts of the Bible. To believe and trust in God, that will happened--especially at the beginning of your faith. But this sort of like/dislike has morphed into a different beast altogether: love and embracing some Scriptures and completely hating other parts.

The most common: loving the Gospels--the defense is "Well, they are about Jesus Christ." In the same breath, you get to hate the writings of Paul. So much so, you can disregard and ignore all of Paul's writings.

The unsaved, unbelieving world--when it approaches the Bible--they will approach it on their own terms not on the terms of God. They will approach the living word of God as people dead in their own sins. They will pick and choose because the entire counsel of God is too much for them to bear. And I agree: it is too much but the Bible is the full counsel of God--it is how God speaks to us. Charismatics, don't tune me out just yet. What does the Bible say we should do when we receive a prophecy? Test it. How do you go about doing that? With the word of God.

What I propose to anyone who will listen: when you read the Bible and it grates against you--that is God at work in you. But you must take that Scripture and read it in light of Scripture.

All the sermons and all the commentaries in the world are a good thing. But all books about God and his word must submit themselves to what the Scriptures say about Scriptures.

We are in Paul's writing. More precisely, Paul's writing to Pastor Titus. If we are not reading this letter in light of the Gospels and the rest of Scriptures, we can lose sight of what God is saying to you and I.

Paul talks about elders of the church to Titus. God is the inspiration and the source of this passage. But it is the same God who told Peter in John 21, "Do you love me, Peter? Then, feed my lambs, shepherd my sheep, feed my sheep."

These qualifications for the shepherds of the church can be wrapped in one statement: you must love the Lord your God and love one another.

## The Text

>Titus 1:5–9 (CSB)  
><sup> 5 </sup>The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town. 

><sup> 6 </sup>An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who are not accused of wildness or rebellion. 

><sup> 7 </sup>As an overseer of God’s household, he must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, 

><sup> 8 </sup>but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, 

><sup> 9 </sup>holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it.

## The Meditation

## Minister Like This: Love God and Be Under Authority

Every Christian is under the authority of Christ under the power of the Almighty Spirit within the Father's sovereign grace and mercy. Those are basic facts.

>Ephesians 1:22-23 (CSB) And he subjected everything under his feet and appointed him as head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.

>Ephesians 5:22-23 (CSB) Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of the body.

>Colossians 1:18 (CSB) He is also the head of the body, the church;
he is the beginning,
the firstborn from the dead,
so that he might come to have
first place in everything.

We know that Christ is the Head Pastor of the Church. We know that he has appointed shepherds to love and care for his lambs. But because we live in a broken, sin-filled world where since Genesis 3, people will blaspheme the name of God by starting what looks to be a church and then deceiving his elect and preying and devouring them for their own twisted hearts. These are false shepherds. They have been with us since God first proclaimed the gospel--people who rose in power here on earth with no fear of the Almighty God of the Universe.

Right now, there are people who are leaving the church. Most of us call it, "deconstruction." Most of us think that people are deconstructing their faith by falling away from orthodox faith so that they can become little heretics and swim in unrepentant sin. 

What I have sin is people stepping away from church because they cannot make sense of a wonderful loving God and yet false shepherds who continue to hurt and try to destroy his little ones.

If church is not even a safe place, where can we go?

And then we end up not being shepherd, not under authority, not care for and not feed.

Christ saw those without shepherds and had compassion.

But Christ is the same Good Shepherd in Jeremiah 23 who saw these false shepherds. He saw them and he removed them. He drew his sheep away for a while and cared for them while he raised up godly qualified shepherds to care for his little ones.

Christ is active not passive in the world. Christ is active and not passive in the Church. You and see him removing unqualified pastors by removing his mercies and letting them fall from grace--for the sake of his people. He will remove these false shepherds who reject the gift of repentance and sometimes he would even close the doors of these churches.

If you know anybody who has been hurt by the church and left the church. Where they are at now is not where they will end up be--by God's grace. Pray for them. Pray that they know the love of God for them.

If you have ever been hurt by a church, know that God sees your pain and your wounds. He is in the business of making you whole and new. And I know this because He sent his only begotten Son to live and die so that you can be whole and new. God did this because he loves you.

Don't process this pain alone. Don't let it drive you into dispair and isolation so that the Devil may come and consume your soul. Reach out to trusted people and if they can't help you for real, then yall together can find someone who can.

Some call it deconstruction. Others are calling it the elect are being swayed away. I am calling it the promises of God are yes and amen.

## Minister Like This: Love God and Love Your Family

>blameless

Right out the gate, where Paul repeats these same qualifications of God to Pastor Timothy, is that an elder, pastor, overseer must be blameless.

Now, we are talking about possessing the righteousness of God that in Christ alone. Not that kind of blameless but every minister (includes you and me) must be blameless in the sight of God. Are we talking about the legalistic, back-breaking moralism that you must appear perfect on the outside while your heart and soul gets wrecked with indwelling sin? No, not that type of fake blameless.

This type of blameless which some translations call "above reproach." What is reproach? Blame. God says his elders of his church must be above blame.

You've heard the phrase, "Where there is smoke, there is fire." God is saying you shouldn't see any smoke. And there is two ways to think about this. One, common sense. "That seems reasonable." 

But the other way is the way of people who have obtain power for themselves and will stop at nothing to hold on that power. They will say things like "What about false accusations?" and "You cannot touch God's annointed." That way of thinking is of Satan--all you are doing is twisting Scripture. Don't go that way.

If in your own church, you are close enough to see the fire and the smoke. In somebody's elses church across the country on the internet, you are not close enough. Christ has you. You will be taken care of.
