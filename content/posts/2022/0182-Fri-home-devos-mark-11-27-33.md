## The Text

>Mark 11:27–33 (CSB)  
><sup> 27 </sup> They came again to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came 

><sup> 28 </sup> and asked him, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do these things?” 

><sup> 29 </sup> Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; then answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 

><sup> 30 </sup> Was John’s baptism from heaven or of human origin? Answer me.” 

><sup> 31 </sup> They discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 

><sup> 32 </sup> But if we say, ‘Of human origin’”—they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was truly a prophet. 

><sup> 33 </sup> So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

## The Prayer from the Psalms

>Psalm 13 (CSB)  
>   For the choir director. A psalm of David. 

><sup> 1 </sup> How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

><sup> 2 </sup> How long will I store up anxious concerns within me, agony in my mind every day? How long will my enemy dominate me? 

><sup> 3 </sup> Consider me and answer, LORD my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death. 

><sup> 4 </sup> My enemy will say, “I have triumphed over him,” and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken. 

><sup> 5 </sup> But I have trusted in your faithful love; my heart will rejoice in your deliverance. 

><sup> 6 </sup> I will sing to the LORD because he has treated me generously.

  O Lord,

You have not forgotten me.
You have not hidden your lovely face from me.
Your comfort and wisdom warm my soul.
Your joy and hope fill my heart all the day long.

You are mindful of me and when I call out your name, you answer me. You have answered me by saving me. You saved me by giving Yourself to me.

One day, I might stare down Death, but when I do, I will only see a crownless king with a broken scepter who has been stripped of power where there is little left to wield.

My Lord and God, all of my trust is in you alone for you alone have the words for eternal life.

Because of You, I sing and dance with complete gladness.

Thank you for You.

In Your Son’s incredible and mighty name, I pray.
Amen.
```
