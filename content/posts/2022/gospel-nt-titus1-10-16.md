## The Text

>Titus 1:10–16 (CSB)  
><sup> 10 </sup> For there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. 

><sup> 11 </sup> It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly.

><sup> 12 </sup> One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”

><sup> 13 </sup> This testimony is true. For this reason, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith 

><sup> 14 </sup> and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of people who reject the truth. 

><sup> 15 </sup> To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled. 

><sup> 16 </sup> They claim to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
