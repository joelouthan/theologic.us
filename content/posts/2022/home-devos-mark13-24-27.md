>Mark 13:24–27 (CSB)  
><sup> 24 </sup> “But in those days, after that tribulation: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light; 

><sup> 25 </sup> the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. 

><sup> 26 </sup> Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 

><sup> 27 </sup> He will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
