## The Text

>Mark 11:20–25 (CSB)  
><sup> 20 </sup> Early in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up. 

><sup> 21 </sup> Then Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” 

><sup> 22 </sup> Jesus replied to them, “Have faith in God. 

><sup> 23 </sup> Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 

><sup> 24 </sup> Therefore I tell you, everything you pray and ask for—believe that you have received it and it will be yours. 

><sup> 25 </sup> And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your wrongdoing.”

## The Devotion

## The Sidenote

Where is verse 26?

>Mark 11:26 [But if you don’t forgive, neither will your Father i heaven forgive your wrongdoing.]

The oldest Greek Manuscripts did not include this verse. 

This inclusion and exclusion doesn't break the Bible. This lines up with not only the Gospels:

>Matthew 6:15 (CSB) But if you don’t forgive others, your Father will not forgive your offenses.

But with the gospel of Christ:

>1 John 4:7-8 (CSB) Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
