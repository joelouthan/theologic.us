## The Text

>Titus 1 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness, 

><sup> 2 </sup> in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began. 

><sup> 3 </sup> In his own time he has revealed his word in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior: 

><sup> 4 </sup> To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 

><sup> 5 </sup> The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town. 

><sup> 6 </sup> An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who are not accused of wildness or rebellion. 

><sup> 7 </sup> As an overseer of God’s household, he must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, 

><sup> 8 </sup> but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, 

><sup> 9 </sup> holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. 

><sup> 11 </sup> It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly. 

><sup> 12 </sup> One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> This testimony is true. For this reason, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith 

><sup> 14 </sup> and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of people who reject the truth. 

><sup> 15 </sup> To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled. 

><sup> 16 </sup> They claim to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
