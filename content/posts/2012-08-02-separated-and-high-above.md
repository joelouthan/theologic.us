<pre>For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth;
	you are exalted far above all gods.
O you who love the LORD, hate evil!
	He preserves the lives of his saints;
	he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous,
	and joy for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous,
	and give thanks to his holy name!
Psalm 97:9-12</pre>
