I was once so far from you. I was once lost. I was once your sworn enemy. Instead of casting me out, you sought me out. Instead of leaving me lost, you found me. 

Instead of leaving me to die, you found me and gave me life. Instead being at war with me, you call me friend.

You are my only hope. You are my life. You are my salvation. You alone hold the words of eternal life.

Now my enemies are not whom I see but whom I do not see.  And you have handled my enemies. You slew them and you conquered them—once and for all.

You are the champion. You are the conqueror.

Now I walk firmly in your freedom.

Now I am free to see you, hear you, be with you, talk with you, love you and worship you all the days of my life.

All of this was made possible from your sovereign grace by the power of Your Spirit through Your Son whom poured his life out for us.

My God, I love you. My Spirit, I love you. My Lord, I love you.

Amen.
