<span style="font-weight: 400;">My God in Heaven,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is none like you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are God who sits high above all of my sins, my hardness, my wickedness, my trespasses and my calamity. You are exalted far above all of my gods.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in your steadfast love, abounding grace, and tender mercies, you saved me! You sent your son, Jesus Christ, to come live and die for me. More than that, your Son rose from the grave and conquered all of the sins, hell, Satan, demons, and death once and for all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I live to you and for you and with you and you are with me and in me forever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What can I do but give you thanks and sing praises to you for all of my days?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can I do but tell the world that you alone are God and you alone are mighty to save?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will tell the world that if they turn their face towards you, you will bring them in and you will save them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you are God.</span>

<span style="color: #999999;"><b>Series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very personal and intimate nature of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves. Â Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span></i></span>
