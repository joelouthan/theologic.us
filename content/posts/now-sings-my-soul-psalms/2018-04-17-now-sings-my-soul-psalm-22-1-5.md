<span style="font-weight: 400;">God!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are you?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am in trouble!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sin and wickedness have surrounded me. Everything goes dark and cold. Satan and his minions look upon my flesh with lust and hunger.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Temptations are too much. I cannot do battle. My muscles are weak, small, and frail.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I cry and scream: HELP ME, O GOD!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But you are my powerful Champion. You are the people’s Savior. You are invincible. You are forever strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have praised you in the past and my lips shall sing of your praises for as long as I draw breath and beyond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your people before me trusted you and I trust you now. You have never failed me. Even when there have been moments when I didn’t know your goodness, you were always good.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have rescued my grandmother and my dad.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now rescue me! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Save me, O God.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My life is in your hands.</span>

<span style="color: #999999;"><b>Series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very personal and intimate nature of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span></i></span>
