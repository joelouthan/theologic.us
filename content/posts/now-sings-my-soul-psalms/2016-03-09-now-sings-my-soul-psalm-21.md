My Lord and My God,

My focus is far from you, the one who sets up Kings and puts them down.

I have been distracted by the choosing of kings rather to place my focus on the King of kings.

It is in you, O Lord, where my strength resides
  
my salvation is present
  
my heart&#8217;s desire
  
my soul&#8217;s fulfillment.

Be my provision. Be my grace. Be my mercy.

Be my life. Be my zeal. Be my might.

Be my glory.

Bless me, O Lord.

Smile upon me.

Help me to trust in you, your faithfulness, and your steadfast love.

Hold me in your hands.

Protect me from the enemy of my soul.

My life is yours, O God. I love you with all of my heart.

Amen.
