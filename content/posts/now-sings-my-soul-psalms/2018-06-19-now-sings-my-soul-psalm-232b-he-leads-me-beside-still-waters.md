<pre>
  My Lord,
  
  You are the fountain of true life. 

  I am dead without you. 
  	It is not that 
    I can find this water on my own. 

  For I am lost
    and, my soul is dried-up and dead. 

  I have no wisdom, 
  	strength, 
  	or spirit to find you.
  
  But you, O Lord, rescued me.
  
  You have brought me into your life 
  	and in your life alone, 
  	I am <em>fully</em> alive. 

  My soul is no longer dried in sin 
  	but restored, 
  	covered, 
  	and filled with your forever grace.
  
  God, please keep me close 
  	so that I stay refreshed 
  	and satisfied in all of life.
  
</pre>
