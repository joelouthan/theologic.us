<p class="p1">
  My Lord,
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are the Prince of Peace. Where you are, there I find satisfaction of my wearied soul and find perfect peace where I can truly rest.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Apart from you, I die and I perish. Away from you, I am only tormented by confusion and despair. Without you, there is nothing but destructions by my own hands and by everything around me.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But you, O Lord, call me to enter through you and abide in you. Once I am in your good graces, you take the back-breaking weight of sin off me and place it upon you. Once more, you lay your light, featherweight righteousness upon me. I am no longer under crushing condemnation nor your furious wrath but yet, within the protection of your great arm and the coolness within your great fortress, that is the Rock of Ages.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Once more, you are the truth. While my heart strays and wanders from you, you are the Good Shepherd who would gladly chase me down and bring home over and over again. Because you alone have the words of eternal life, I have nowhere else to go but to come home with you.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I thank you for healing my broken heart and mind. I thank you for opening my eyes, ears, and mouth of your glory and goodness. I thank you for giving me strength for you are Christ Jesus my Lord forever.
