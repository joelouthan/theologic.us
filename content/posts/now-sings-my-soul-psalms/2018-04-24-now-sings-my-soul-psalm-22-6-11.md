<span style="font-weight: 400;">My Lord,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who am I that I have been rejected a million times and despised a million times more?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You say, “Speak of my love” and it falls on deaf ears. You say, “Speak of my power” and it means little to the strong. You say, “Speak of my glory” and their eyes remain blind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you saved me. You made me with your hands. You are the one who started my heartbeat. More than that, when I was wicked and evil and when I despised your holy name, you did nothing but see me and let your grace and love fall on me. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once more, you were always my God. Even after my mother abandoned me and while my father sought to destroy me, You were my God.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when I didn’t know you, your righteousness and holiness tainted my walking corpse and I tasted of your power.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But your mercies come quickly: you followed that up with your heart in place of mine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be ever so close to me. Be the whisper that draws me out&#8211;yes, even into the wilderness. Because if I have You, then I have everything I need.</span>

<span style="color: #999999;"><b>Series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very personal and intimate nature of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span></i></span>
