</div>

You have not forgotten me.

You have not hidden your lovely face from me.

Your comfort and wisdom warm my soul.

Your joy and hope fill my heart all the day long.

You are mindful of me and when I call out your name, you answer me. You have answered me by saving me. You saved me by giving Yourself to me.

One day, I might stare down Death, but when I do, I will only see a crownless king with a broken scepter who has been stripped of power where there is little left to wield.

My Lord and God, all of my trust is in you alone for you alone have the words for eternal life.

Because of You, I sing and dance with complete gladness.

Thank you for You.

In Your Son’s incredible and mighty name, I pray.

Amen.

**Series: **As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very _personal and intimate nature_ of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.
