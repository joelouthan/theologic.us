<pre>
  My Lord and my God,
  
  Even when I was dead,
  	you called my name.
  
  Even when I was lost, 
  	you found me.
  
  Even when I was blind,
  	you touched my eyes 
    and opened them to see.
  
  Even when I was deaf,
  	you opened them to hear.
  
  Even when I was hard-hearted, 
  	you took my heart of stone 
    and gave me your tender heart.
  
  Even when I couldnâ€™t know you,
  	you gave me Your Spirit.
  
  Even when I am in the wilderness,
  	you are closer to me than a whisper.
  
  You are my God. I will adore 
  and worship you forever.
  </pre>
