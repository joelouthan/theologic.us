<pre><blockquote>
  My Lord,
  
  I am reminded of all of your sweet blessings. 
  
  You are my inheritance.
  You are my portion.
  You are my lot.
  
  Because you are my Christ, the Son of God, in whom is my All-of-all.
  
  My God, you have called me into your family and I share my inheritance.
  
  But just as you drank from the cup, I gladly and with great joy drink from the cup.
  
  I am yours and your are my Beloved forever.
  
  Thank you for saving me.
  
  Thank you for loving me.
  
  Thank you for being my everything.
  
</blockquote></pre>
