<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Blessed Redeemer,</div>
Your Word stands true.

For you have declared that,  
	your law is perfect  
	and it revives my soul.

Your testimony is *sure*,  
  turning my foolishness  
  into wisdom.

Moreover, your precepts are always right,  
	my heart rejoices.

Your commandments are pure,  
	now my eyes can now see.

To fear you is my righteousness,  
  I will be with you forever.

Once more, your rules are truth,  
	and right-standing altogether.

I desire you, O Lord,  
	more so than all the riches.

I love you, my God,  
	and you are sweeter than honey,  
	and the drippings of  
		a honeycomb.

If you say you have spoken to me,  
	then you will abide me forever.

If you say your Son died for me  
	then I will live to you forever.

If you say your Spirit has sealed me,  
	then I am yours forever.
 
Be exalted in my praise,  
	my Lord and God.
</pre>
