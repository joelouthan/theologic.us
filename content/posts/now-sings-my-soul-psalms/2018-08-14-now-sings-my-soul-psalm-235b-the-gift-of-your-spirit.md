<pre><blockquote>
  My God,
  
  Because of everything your Son has done for me, I now walk in the power of Your Spiirt.
  
  He leads me. He guides me. He teaches me. 
  
  He reminds me of what You have said. He reminds me of my righteousness. He reminds me that I am your son.
  
  More so than that, He is the seal upon my heart
  and the promise of your strength.
  And because He dwells in me, I fear no death.
  Because he is the same Spirit that raised Christ Jesus from the dead.
  
  And because He is in me,
  I have the fullness of life.
  I am truly alive.
  
  I am holy, righteous, just;
  loved, and continuous under your grace and mercy.
  
  Because of your anointing on my life.
  
</blockquote></pre>
