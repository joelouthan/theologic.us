<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  Dear God,
</div>

Help!

You have helped me in the past and this time I still need you.

I have dismissed all the lies around me.

I still need you.

I still need your love.

I still need your mercy.

I still need your grace.

Give me your hand.

I need to feel your embrace.

I need to feel your warmth.

I know you are always with me.

Right now, I will lay in peace.

Because you are with me.

Selah.

**Series: **As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very _personal and intimate nature_ of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.
