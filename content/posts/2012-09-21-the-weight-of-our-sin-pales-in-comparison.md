There is no weight of sin that the weight of His glory is not heavier still. The is no shame so bright that His blood cannot blot out. There is no destructive guilt that God&#8217;s love that does not shield. There is no disease that God&#8217;s will does not heal. There is no death that Christ has not conquered. **There is no pit that is so deeper that Christ is not deeper still.** There is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because in his presence is the fullness of joy and at his right hand are pleasures forevermore. 

&#8211; _inspired by Corrie Ten Boom_
