## The Text

>Ruth 3:1-9 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, shouldn’t I find rest for you, so that you will be taken care of?

><sup>2</sup> Now isn’t Boaz our relative? Haven’t you been working with his female servants? This evening he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.

><sup>3</sup> Wash, put on perfumed oil, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.

><sup>4</sup> When he lies down, notice the place where he’s lying, go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. Then he will explain to you what you should do.”

><sup>5</sup> So Ruth said to her, “I will do everything you say.”

><sup>6</sup> She went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had charged her to do.

><sup>7</sup> After Boaz ate, drank, and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of barley, and she came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.

><sup>8</sup> At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman!

><sup>9</sup> So he asked, “Who are you?” “I am Ruth, your servant,” she replied. “Take me under your wing, for you are a family redeemer.”

## Some Considerations

>Philippians 4:8 (CSB) Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any moral excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—dwell on these things.

## God

><sup>1</sup> Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, shouldn’t I find rest for you, so that you will be taken care of?

### God's Redeeming Work: Christ is Our Final Rest

- Continuous work not sustainable
- Consider physical fitness - lift all weights in the world but without rest, it was as though you never lifted--the work doesn't count

>Matthew 11:28 (CSB) Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

>Psalms 16:11 (CSB) You reveal the path of life to me;  
>in your presence is abundant joy;  
>at your right hand are eternal pleasures.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

><sup>2-3</sup> Now isn’t Boaz our relative? Haven’t you been working with his female servants? This evening he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. Wash, put on perfumed oil, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.

### God's Redeeming Work: He Does The Work

- He dresses you in his righteousness
- He anoints you with oil
- 
But where we are commanded by God to do this and yet cannot, he sent his Son to come do this for us so that we might live!

>Matthew 5:17-18 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished.

>Luke 15:22 (CSB) “But the father told his servants, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

>Titus 3:4-7 (CSB) But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us —not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy — through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.

><sup>4</sup> When he lies down, notice the place where he’s lying, go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. Then he will explain to you what you should do.”

### God's Redeeming Work: He Protects You

>Ezekiel 16:8 (CSB) “ ‘Then I passed by you and saw you, and you were indeed at the age for love. So I spread the edge of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I pledged myself to you, entered into a covenant with you—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—and you became mine.

>Psalms 23:1-3 (CSB) The LORD is my shepherd;  
>I have what I need.  
>He lets me lie down in green pastures;  
>he leads me beside quiet waters.  
>He renews my life;  
>he leads me along the right paths  
>for his name’s sake.

- Adopts into the fold of God
- Provides your needs
- Gives you rest
- Cleanses you--gives water for your thirst
- Restores your soul
- Makes your righteous
- To glorify his name

>Matthew 23:37-39 (CSB) “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord’! ”
