## The Gospel

><sup>8</sup> Naomi said to them, “Each of you go back to your mother’s home. May the LORD show kindness to you as you have shown to the dead and to me.

><sup>9</sup> May the LORD grant each of you rest in the house of a new husband.” She kissed them, and they wept loudly.

><sup>10</sup> They said to her, “We insist on returning with you to your people.”

><sup>11</sup> But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands?

><sup>12</sup> Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,

><sup>13</sup> would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying? No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the LORD’s hand has turned against me.”

><sup>14</sup> Again they wept loudly, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.

><sup>15</sup> Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Follow your sister-in-law.”

><sup>16</sup> But Ruth replied: Don’t plead with me to abandon you or to return and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.

><sup>17</sup> Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and do so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.

><sup>18</sup> When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped talking to her.

### God Predestines: God is Kind

>Romans 2:4 (CSB) Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

The bitterness of Naomi is not unlike the lamentations of Job. We don't know what God is doing in the times of distress and persecution or why he would be do certain things. But He alone is the source of good. What he does is good things. 

As sons of Adam, we will take God's good gift and corrupt it somehow. That started in the garden, Adam and Eve, took the righteousness of of God and exchanged it for their own righteous. But what we meant for evil, God will always used it for good. (Genesis 50:20)

God provided a way out like he does with with Israel back in Exodus but their hearts turn towards somebody not God but a god that they can fashion and form with their own hands (which God created) and with the treasure received from the Egyptians (which God has graciously provided.)

In Romans 9, we see God hardens the heart of Pharaoh in order to save his people but the people did trust and obey and kept turn back to their slavery days.

>Romans 9:6-8 (CSB) Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Neither is it the case that all of Abraham’s children are his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring.

What we see in the actions of the Jews in Exodus through Judges that God saves and his people keep turning away.

We see the hand of God in Naomi's life and we are having a front row seat to her heart.  What we would God do?

>God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance

Make no mistake, Naomi's bitterness is turn into sin against God. But God is kind to Naomi and kind to us. God gives his heart, his Spirit, the faith to believe and he gives the gift of repentance so that we can always turn back and run into the arms of the Savior who is always waiting for us.

>Matthew 7:13-14 (CSB) “Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it. How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it.

## Our Response

><sup>19</sup> The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and the local women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”

><sup>20</sup> “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,” she answered, “for the Almighty has made me very bitter.

><sup>21</sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has opposed me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”

><sup>22</sup> So Naomi came back from the territory of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

### God Predestines: God is deserving of our praise
