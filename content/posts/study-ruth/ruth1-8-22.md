## God

><sup>8</sup> Naomi said to them, “Each of you go back to your mother’s home. May the LORD show kindness to you as you have shown to the dead and to me.

><sup>9</sup> May the LORD grant each of you rest in the house of a new husband.” She kissed them, and they wept loudly.

><sup>10</sup> They said to her, “We insist on returning with you to your people.”

><sup>11</sup> But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands?

><sup>12</sup> Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,

><sup>13</sup> would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying? No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the LORD’s hand has turned against me.”

><sup>14</sup> Again they wept loudly, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.

><sup>15</sup> Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Follow your sister-in-law.”

><sup>16</sup> But Ruth replied: Don’t plead with me to abandon you or to return and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.

><sup>17</sup> Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and do so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.

><sup>18</sup> When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped talking to her.

### God Predestines: God is Kind

>Romans 2:4 (CSB) Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

The bitterness of Naomi is not unlike the lamentations of Job. We don't know what God is doing in the times of distress and persecution or why he would be do certain things. But He alone is the source of good. What he does is good things. 

As sons of Adam, we will take God's good gift and corrupt it somehow. That started in the garden, Adam and Eve, took the righteousness of of God and exchanged it for their own righteous. But what we meant for evil, God will always used it for good. (Genesis 50:20)

God provided a way out like he does with with Israel back in Exodus but their hearts turn towards somebody not God but a god that they can fashion and form with their own hands (which God created) and with the treasure received from the Egyptians (which God has graciously provided.)

In Romans 9, we see God hardens the heart of Pharaoh in order to save his people but the people did trust and obey and kept turn back to their slavery days.

>Romans 9:6-8 (CSB) Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Neither is it the case that all of Abraham’s children are his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring.

What we see in the actions of the Jews in Exodus through Judges that God saves and his people keep turning away.

We see the hand of God in Naomi's life and we are having a front row seat to her heart.  What we would God do?

>God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance

Make no mistake, Naomi's bitterness is turn into sin against God. But God is kind to Naomi and kind to us. God gives his heart, his Spirit, the faith to believe and he gives the gift of repentance so that we can always turn back and run into the arms of the Savior who is always waiting for us.

Think about when God was so kind to you, even in the midst of your anger and bitterness on how life turned out.

>Ruth 1:10–13 (CSB) They said to her, “We insist on returning with you to your people.” But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands? Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying? No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the LORD’s hand has turned against me.”

### God Predestines: God Has Show Us the Path of Life

>Matthew 7:13-14 (CSB) “Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it. How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it.

>Matthew 13:18-23 (CSB) “So listen to the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path. And the one sown on rocky ground — this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. But he has no root and is short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away. Now the one sown among the thorns — this is one who hears the word, but the worries of this age and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. But the one sown on the good ground — this is one who hears and understands the word, who does produce fruit and yields: some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”

Christ explained the kingdom of God:

- **Unbelievers cannot understand** - we cannot understand the supernatural unless Someone gives us supernatural understanding
- **Sometimes, the news is good but does not take root** - the gospel is fantastic news but as soon as life comes to kick in you in the pricks, the good news is not enough anymore [^acts9-6kjv]
- **Believers had the work of the Spirit** the heart has been made good and the Spirit dwells in them in order for them to believe and the gospel takes root and produces fruit.

[^acts9-6kjv]: Acts 9:5 (KJV 1900) And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

Right now, in this passage in Ruth, you are seeing this take place. The same life goad-kicking circumstances--loss of spouse--happened to all three women. And in the ancient world, when a woman lost her husband and have no family to speak of, that meant certain death. Women had no status to speak of, no rights and no help. That is why the law of God was so bent in watching out for the widow--women were always terribly vulnerable and God gave the law in order for us to watch out for them and care for them.

You had no husband, no work, no wealth, no immediate family and you have two choices:

- go back to the world you once knew
- go with God

The Bible never said what happened to Orpah even though we know that she heard the good news of God and for a while it was good. This is like the story of the Rich Young Ruler in Matthew 19.

>Matthew 19:22 (CSB) When the young man heard that, he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.

We read this and the one of Orpah and may have the evangelical thinking of the opposite of "once saved always saved" in that "once rejected always damned". But we know from John 3 that is not how the Holy Spirit works. We know from the Parable of the Sower that is not how Christ works. Christ sows the word and Holy Spirit works the soil in us.

We don't know what happens to Orpah and the rich young ruler. But remember Nicodemus in John 3, the teacher and ruler who came to Christ under the covering of night?

>John 19:39 (CSB) Nicodemus (who had previously come to him at night) also came, bringing a mixture of about seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes.

Christ personally preached the gospel to Nicodemus. And perhaps it took all of the life of Nicodemus plus a few more years for the Spirit to work in him.

>John 19:40 (CSB) They took Jesus’s body and wrapped it in linen cloths with the fragrant spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.

Nicodemus went from not understanding to Christ to physically carrying out Romans 6.

But in this moment in Ruth, Ruth clings to Naomi.

><sup>16-18</sup> But Ruth replied: Don’t plead with me to abandon you or to return and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and do so severely, if anything but death separates you and me. When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped talking to her.

### God Predestines: God Saves Us

Same goad-kicking life circumstances. Two sisters. One couldn't take it anymore and had to go back to the life she once knew.

Ruth, however, was born again. Christ preaches incessantly that for anybody to see the kingdom of God, you must be born again. In other words, you have to be a new creation in Christ. In other words, you have to have a new heart, His Spirit dwelling in you, your mind renew, your eyes opened, your ears unplugged, and your dead wicked tongue made alive. You may look no different on the outside but the inside, not even the same person.

Ruth did not know what Bethlehem had in store for her. All she knew was that Naomi worshipped the One True Living God and back home, they did not. She had nothing for the world because the world had nothing for her--just tons of turds. But going with her mother-in-law meant she would follow the Lord. And if she perished soon thereafter, she would still have life because she would behold her God.

## Our Response

><sup>19</sup> The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and the local women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”

><sup>20</sup> “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,” she answered, “for the Almighty has made me very bitter.

><sup>21</sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has opposed me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”

><sup>22</sup> So Naomi came back from the territory of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
