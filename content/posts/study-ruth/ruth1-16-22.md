## The Text

>Ruth 1:16-22 (CSB)  
><sup>16</sup> But Ruth replied: Don’t plead with me to abandon you or to return and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.

><sup>17</sup> Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and do so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.

><sup>18</sup> When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped talking to her.

><sup>19</sup> The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and the local women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” 

><sup>20</sup> “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,” she answered, “for the Almighty has made me very bitter. 

><sup>21</sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has opposed me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?” 

><sup>22</sup> So Naomi came back from the territory of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

## Some Considerations

>Philippians 4:8 (CSB) Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any moral excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—dwell on these things.

1. Think about the sweetness and patience of God in your own life--he saved you but you kept trying to choose your own way--even unto figurative death like death of relationships, or careers, or life circumstances.
2. When was that first moment in your own life where your faced towards God and could not turn back? Perhaps that has always been your life because you have always known the love of God. But perhaps you have seen two worlds and had to choose one.
3. Think on the goodness of God.

## God

### God Predestines: God Saves Us

Same goad-kicking life circumstances. Two sisters. One couldn't take it anymore and had to go back to the life she once knew.

I contend to you that Ruth was born again. Christ preaches incessantly that for anybody to see the kingdom of God, you must be born again. In other words, you have to be a new creation in Christ. In other words, you have to have a new heart, His Spirit dwelling in you, your mind renewed, your eyes opened, your ears unplugged, and your dead wicked tongue made alive. You may look no different on the outside but the inside, not even the same person.

Ruth did not know what Bethlehem had in store for her. All she knew was that Naomi worshipped the One True Living God. But back home? They did not. Ruth made a choice because she was gripped by the kindness and goodness of the loving God. She, in turn, had nothing for the world because the world had nothing for her. Just tons of turds. 

>Luke 14:33 (CSB) In the same way, therefore, every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple.

Ruth counted and calculated the cost of what it meant to follow God. But going with her mother-in-law also meant that she did not know what was in store for her and her mother-in-law. But if she went back, perhaps she would die but surely she would perish in the wrath of the Almighty God. Going with Naomi? Meant her chances of dying greatly increased but she would never perish but have everlasting life.

## Our Response

>Ruth 1:19-22 (CSB) The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and the local women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,” she answered, “for the Almighty has made me very bitter. I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has opposed me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?” So Naomi came back from the territory of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

### God Predestines: God Dwells in You

I want to have us let loose the notion that God does not care about you. He cares for you so deeply that not only he sent his Son to live and die for you, he sent his Spirit to give you life, a new heart, and a renew mind. And not only did he send his Spirit, God Father Almighty has made his home in you with his Son and Spirit. 

But let also forget the notion that while God cares deeply for you, he is not to be bothered by the details of your life.

We have read the Bible. We know for a fact that God is not only in the details, he is in the details of your life!

"But, wait a second, if he cares so much about the details of my life, why do I still experience pain and suffering here on earth."

The same Christ who gives us real rest is same Christ who promised suffering if we follow him.

>Romans 8:17 (CSB) and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. 

The moment we turned to Christ meant that we turned away from the world. To have our face set towards God who saves is to turn our face against the world.

We are in this world but not of it. And the Father using anything good or evil and using the heavens and earth to conforming you to make you look like his Son will not be painless. Your new birth started with coming from death unto life with his Spirit performing an instant heart and brain transplant.

And we all know the recovery from surgery is long and difficult. No less so for born again Christians how have been crucified with Christ.

But God was there when he made you in your mother's womb (Psalm 139:13)

And from birth, he has always been your God (Psalm 22:10)

He alone has determined when you will be born and where you will live so that others might seek him (Psalm 139:8-10; Acts 17:22-34)

God searched you and knows you (Psalm 139:1)

God knows your thoughts (Psalm 139:2)

God is acutely aware of your ways (Psalm 139:3)

Before you speak a word and have it in your heart, God knows it (Psalm 139:4)

But God has always been there with you and protecting you from real danger and threat (Psalm 139:5)

To know that God loves me and cares for me perfectly, intensely, and most intimately, is the greatest relief and peace in the world.

>Psalm 139:6 (CSB) This wondrous knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to reach it.

Because despite my not-perfect and not-good motives, Christ is my righteousness and my All-in-all. He is enough because he is everything. I cannot repent enough or be sincere enough or have enough faith or be good enough. Christ is my perfect obedience. I know when I do something that the world or even Christians call good, if I dig that source up out of my flesh, it started something bad. But because I have Christ, I know whatever Christ did, it was purely good because he is the source of God.

So whatever sufferings we might face now or will face, we have the glory of Christ:

>Romans 8:18 (CSB) For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.
