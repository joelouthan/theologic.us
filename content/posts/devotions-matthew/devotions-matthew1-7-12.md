## The Devotion

### The Promise

>2 Samuel 7:8-16 (CSB) “So now this is what you are to say to my servant David: ‘This is what the LORD of Armies says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a great name for you like that of the greatest on the earth. I will designate a place for my people Israel and plant them, so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they have done ever since the day I ordered judges to be over my people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies.
>
>“‘The LORD declares to you: The LORD himself will make a house for you. When your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with a rod of men and blows from mortals. But my faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever.’”

### The Curse

>Jeremiah 22:24–30 (CSB)  
><sup> 24 </sup> “As I live”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“though you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would tear you from it. 

><sup> 25 </sup> In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who intend to take your life, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans. 

><sup> 26 </sup> I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another land, where neither of you were born, and there you will both die. 

><sup> 27 </sup> They will never return to the land they long to return to.” 

><sup> 28 </sup> Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, a jar no one wants? Why are he and his descendants hurled out and cast into a land they have not known? 

><sup> 29 </sup> Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD! 

><sup> 30 </sup> This is what the LORD says: Record this man as childless, a man who will not be successful in his lifetime. None of his descendants will succeed in sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah.

### The Fulfillment

>Luke 3:23–32 (CSB)  
><sup> 23 </sup> As he began his ministry, Jesus was about thirty years old and was thought to be the son of Joseph, son of Heli, 

><sup> 24 </sup> son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph, 

><sup> 25 </sup> son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai, 

><sup> 26 </sup> son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda, 

><sup> 27 </sup> son of Joanan, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri, 

><sup> 28 </sup> son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er, 

><sup> 29 </sup> son of Joshua, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi, 

><sup> 30 </sup> son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim, 

><sup> 31 </sup> son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David, 

><sup> 32 </sup> son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,

### The Workaround

>Numbers 27:1-11 (CSB) The daughters of Zelophehad approached; Zelophehad was the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh from the clans of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They stood before Moses, the priest Eleazar, the leaders, and the entire community at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said, “Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among Korah’s followers, who gathered together against the LORD. Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons. Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan? Since he had no son, give us property among our father’s brothers.”
>
>Moses brought their case before the LORD, and the LORD answered him, “What Zelophehad’s daughters say is correct. You are to give them hereditary property among their father’s brothers and transfer their father’s inheritance to them. Tell the Israelites: When a man dies without having a son, transfer his inheritance to his daughter. If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. If his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative of his clan, and he will take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites as the LORD commanded Moses.”
