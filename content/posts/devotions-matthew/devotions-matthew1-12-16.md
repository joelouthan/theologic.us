## The Devotion

Think through Abraham through David down to Joseph.

Think of the sins and the failures and the blood curses of the Christians before us.

Think of what Christ, as God Almighty, responding to the real needs of his people.

Think on the faith that God gave each one and it is the same faith for you and me.

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring.
He will strike your head,
and you will strike his heel.

>Galatians 3:16 (CSB) Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say “and to seeds,” as though referring to many, but referring to one, and to your seed, who is Christ.

The faith to believe God. The heart to love God. The mind of Christ. The Spirit to bond us to God.

>Isaiah 61:1-3 (CSB) The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me,  
>because the LORD has anointed me  
>to bring good news to the poor.  
>He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,  
>to proclaim liberty to the captives  
>and freedom to the prisoners;  
>to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,  
>and the day of our God’s vengeance;  
>to comfort all who mourn,  
>to provide for those who mourn in Zion;  
>to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,  
>festive oil instead of mourning,  
>and splendid clothes instead of despair.  
>And they will be called righteous trees,  
>planted by the LORD  
>to glorify him.

Christ knew who he was--even if people didn't believe him right away. The Triune God made these plans before Genesis 1:1. They didn't need for any of us to the right thing or make the right decision. God would do it. God has complete it because He sent His Son in the power of the Spirit. 

God will give us a Deliverer. God will give us a Savior. God will give us the Annointed One--the Messiah of his people. One and done forever.
