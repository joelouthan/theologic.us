## The Text

>Matthew 1:22-23 (CSB) Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:  
>See, the virgin will become pregnant  
>and give birth to a son,  
>and they will name him Immanuel,  
>which is translated “God is with us.”

## The Devotion

### Attiyq Youm: The Ancient of Days

>Daniel 7:9 (CSB) “As I kept watching,
thrones were set in place,
and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
His clothing was white like snow,
and the hair of his head like whitest wool.
His throne was flaming fire;
its wheels were blazing fire.

### El Chuwl: The God Who Gave You Birth

>Isaiah 43:1-4 (CSB) 
Now this is what the LORD says —
the one who created you, Jacob,
and the one who formed you, Israel —
“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
I have called you by your name; you are mine.
When you pass through the waters,
I will be with you,
and the rivers will not overwhelm you.
When you walk through the fire,
you will not be scorched,
and the flame will not burn you.
For I am the LORD your God,
the Holy One of Israel, and your Savior.
I have given Egypt as a ransom for you,
Cush and Seba in your place.
Because you are precious in my sight
and honored, and I love you,
I will give people in exchange for you
and nations instead of your life.

### El Deah: The God of Knowledge

>1 Samuel 2:3 (CSB) Do not boast so proudly,
or let arrogant words come out of your mouth,
for the LORD is a God of knowledge,
and actions are weighed by him.

### El Elyon: The God Most High

>Psalms 97:9 (CSB) For you, LORD,
are the Most High over the whole earth;
you are exalted above all the gods.

### El Olam: The Everlasting God

>Psalms 90:1-2 (ESV) 
Lord, you have been our dwelling place
in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth,
or ever you had formed the earth and the world,
from everlasting to everlasting you are God.

### El Roi: The God Who Sees

>Genesis 16:13 (CSB) So she named the LORD who spoke to her: “You are El-roi,” for she said, “In this place, have I actually seen the one who sees me?

### El Shaddai: God Almighty

>Genesis 17:1-2 (CSB) When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, “I am God Almighty. Live in my presence and be blameless. I will set up my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you greatly.”

### Elohim: The Creator

>Genesis 1:1 (CSB) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

### Jehovah (Yahweh): The Self-Existent One

>Exodus 3:13-14 (CSB) Then Moses asked God, “If I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name? ’ what should I tell them? ”
God replied to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.”

### Jehovah-Bore: The LORD Creator

>Psalms 33:6 (CSB) The heavens were made by the word of the LORD,
and all the stars, by the breath of his mouth.

### Jehovah-Jireh: The LORD Our Provider

>Genesis 22:12-14 (CSB) Then he said, “Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.” Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide, so today it is said, “It will be provided on the LORD’s mountain.”

### Jehovah-Nissi: The LORD Our Banner

>Exodus 17:12-15 (CSB) When Moses’s hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat down on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword.
>
>The LORD then said to Moses, “Write this down on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua: I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek under heaven.”
>
>And Moses built an altar and named it, “The LORD Is My Banner.”

### Jehovah-Rapha: The LORD Our Healer

>Psalms 103:1-5 (CSB) My soul, bless the LORD,
and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
My soul, bless the LORD,
and do not forget all his benefits.
He forgives all your iniquity;
he heals all your diseases.
He redeems your life from the Pit;
he crowns you with faithful love and compassion.
He satisfies you with good things;
your youth is renewed like the eagle.

### Jehovah-Rohi: The LORD Our Shepherd

>Psalms 23:1 (CSB) The LORD is my shepherd;
I have what I need.

### Jehovah-Sabbaoth: The LORD of Hosts

>1 Samuel 17:45 (CSB) David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with a sword, spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Armies, the God of the ranks of Israel — you have defied him.

### Jehovah-Shalom: The LORD is Peace

>Judges 6:23-24 (CSB) But the LORD said to him, “Peace to you. Don’t be afraid, for you will not die.” So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD Is Peace. It is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites today.

### Jehovah-Shammah: The LORD is There

>Ezekiel 48:35; also Psalms 139:7-8 (CSB) 
Where can I go to escape your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?
If I go up to heaven, you are there;
if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.

### Jehovah-Tsidkenu: The LORD Our Righteousness

>Genesis 15:6 (CSB) Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.

### Immanuel: God is with us.

>John 8:56-58 (CSB) Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.”
The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham? ”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.”
