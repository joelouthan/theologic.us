## The Text

>Matthew 1:17 (CSB) So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah, fourteen generations.

## The Devotion

> all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations;

### The God of Abraham

>Genesis 15:4-7 (CSB) Now the word of the LORD came to him: “This one will not be your heir; instead, one who comes from your own body will be your heir.” He took him outside and said, “Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “Your offspring will be that numerous.”
Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.
He also said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”

What did Christ say about this!

>John 8:54-58 (CSB) “If I glorify myself,” Jesus answered, “my glory is nothing. My Father — about whom you say, ‘He is our God’ — he is the one who glorifies me. You do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say I don’t know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.”
>
>The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham? ”
>
>Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.”

### The God of David

> and from David until the exile to Babylon

>2 Samuel 7:12-16 (CSB) When your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with a rod of men and blows from mortals. But my faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever.’ ”

What did Christ say about this?

>Mark 12:35-37 (CSB) While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked, “How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself says by the Holy Spirit:  
>The Lord declared to my Lord,  
>‘Sit at my right hand  
>until I put your enemies under your feet.’  
>David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How, then, can he be his son? ” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.

### The God of the Exiles

>from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah

>Jeremiah 29:10-14 (CSB) For this is what the LORD says: “When seventy years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm my promise concerning you to restore you to this place. For I know the plans I have for you” — this is the LORD’s declaration — “plans for your well-being, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. You will call to me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart. I will be found by you” — this is the LORD’s declaration — “and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you” — this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place from which I deported you.”

Christ is the plan.

Christ is our well-being.

Christ is our future.

Christ is our hope.

We call upon his name and we believe and we are saved.

We pray and he will listen to us.

We seek him with all of our heart, we will find him.

We are the exiles long departed from God.

Yet Christ is our God!
