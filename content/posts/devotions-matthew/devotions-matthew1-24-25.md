## The Text

> Matthew 1:24-25 (CSB) When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.

## The Devotion

What I am about to show you might sound like a stretch at first. But I want you and me not to glance over these two little verses before we get to Chapter Two.

I want us not only to see God in his word but to see God’s grace in the life of Joseph and Mary in order for them to do His will.

### When Joseph woke up

Our tomorrow is never a guarantee by God.

For:
>Proverbs 27:1 (CSB) Don’t boast about tomorrow,
for you don’t know what a day might bring.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. 

God gives all grace for you to obey him. For:

>Ezekiel 36:24-27 (CSB) “ ‘For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. 25 I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### He married her

Before the sin entered into our world, we were blessed with a few things: love, righteousness, holiness, rest, work, and marriage. These were gifts of God. For:

>Genesis 2:24 (CSB) This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### but did not have sexual relations with her

In obey God, we never have to disobey God. Joseph was bethroth to her and would be her husband. Joseph was holy because God is holy. He never had disobey in order to glorify God.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### until she gave birth to a son. 

Joseph and Mary was given a son that was not their own in so many ways. Mary didn’t want it this way but God spoke and she was called. Joseph didn’t want it this way. But God spoke and he was called. And they were given the grace to do his will.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### And he named him Jesus.

Did they know what they were getting into? No, not all the way. Mary and Joseph desired to be obedient and wanted to please God. They didn’t see the entire full picture but they didn’t have to. God gives the grace for us to do his will.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!
