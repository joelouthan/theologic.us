## The Introduction

So why start up a new series? Do I need another series like I need another hole in my head? Perhaps.

We moved to Kentucky from Oklahoma in early 2022 with my in-laws coming with. I started this series in anticipation that we might not find a local church instantly (Note: despite the published date, I am writing this on October 15, 2022. In short, God provided quickly. Praise be to God. - Ed.) and wanted to be prepared from the jump not going to church for a long while. Keeping it all the way real with you: I knew my in-laws would be slow going to church (Note: they still haven't gone. Pray for them. - Also, Ed.) and wanted to provide the word of God to them.

We did end up finding a church by April and have been faithfully attending. It was God's grace I started this series and by his grace, I will finish it.

## It Goes Without Say

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

<img src="/images/resources/commentary-calvin-set.png" align="left" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />Calvin's Commentaries  
by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.  
[Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17517)

<p style="clear:both;">

<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

<img src="/images/resources/commentary-esv-expository-set.jpg" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />ESV Expository Commentary: Matthew–Luke (Volume, 8)  
by Dan Doriani (Author)  
Iain M. Duguid, James M. Hamilton Jr., & Jay Sklar (Editors)  
Crossway. September 7, 2021.
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50611048-esv-expository-commentary-volume-8?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FBpWi6R83q&rank=1)

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.

by R.C. Sproul.  
Ligonier Ministries. October 29, 2019.
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14453116-matthew?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ApRYo1wv79&rank=1)

If Sproul wrote it, 9.9/10 I am going to read it, use it, quote it, and recommend it. This volume is no exception.

I am familiar with Blomberg. And I do like this series. This will also be referenced.
