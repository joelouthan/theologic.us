<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Creator and Redeemer
</div>
You are majestic
  and altogether mighty.

You alone brought something
  out of nothing.
  You alone can do that.

When you created me,
  you did so from what was created.
  Out of dirt.

  But you also created me
  out of your heart
  because of your love for me.

  And you created me
  out of your begotten
  for He was the firstborn
  among many brethen.

Because of my sin
  I was destined to go back into dirt
  apart from you
  and under your wrath.

Yet, in your great love,
  you predestined me
  not to dirt but to life
  not apart but to fullness of joy
  not under your wrath but under your right hand
  with pleasures forevermore.

Amen.
</pre>
