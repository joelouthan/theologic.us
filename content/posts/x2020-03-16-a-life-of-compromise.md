**How in the fuck did I get here?**

Every single damn time I tell this story, I tell it in such a way that I get a "Oh that is so sweet, I am going to die" response that makes people feel all gooey inside. 

Okay, it is romantic. Sure. But what happens after that is a fucking nightmare. 

So here's the romantic part of this story that makes it seem like I am here, alive, writing these words, because of *true love*. 

Let's say, it's the summer of '73. If you ever visit Fort Worth, Texas and catch yourself on the Northside of town, find Carter-Riverside High School. As you face the front of the building, look to your right and find the street corner in front of the school. Count three trees down towards you. That tree right there? That's the tree that faithfully stopped my future dad and his best friend from drinking and driving. It was also the tree that dramatically changed the course of my dad's life and had a direct impact of whether I was going to be born or not.

Here's what happened: dad and his friend goes out drinking and driving. Except this time, they crashed into this destiny-changing tree. Both men were also not wearing seatbelts (because 70's but also, being stupid). Riley had the blessing of having his trajectory stopped by convenient placement of the car's steering wheel. That sucker ain't moving. My dad only had the front windshield to stop him. And stopping him, it did not. My dad smashed face first all the way through the glass, hits the tree in front and bounced back through the same windshield right back into his seat.

My dad was jacked up. His face was tore up by countless shards of glass. He wasn't pretty to begin with and this incident didn't make him any better looking. 

His mom (my grandmother), I am sure, freaked out of her mind. Fortunately, my dad was employed by an organization with deep, deep medical expertise and pockets to match. You might know them as the United States Army. And by employed, I mean drafted into a little war in the country of Vietnam. (Why the hell we were there, we have really no good reason. But I digress.) My dad's company commander told my grandma, "Ma'am, we have the best plastic surgeons in the world down at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. If they can't fix his face, no one can."

So taking parts of his thigh and his butt, they redrafted his ear and nose and fixed his face. Hand to God.

Having a tore-up ugly face does not really changes up your destiny *except* when your face needs so much healing, the US Army decides *not* to ship you to Vietnam and instead ships you about 2,000 miles north of Vietnam to another Asian country called South Korea.

My dad is allowed to grow a beard. But that opens the door for every single CO and NCO on his new base in South Korea to rip you a new asshole for being out of regulations. Being in a lot of pain and feeling like crap, he decides to visit a local bar to drink it all away. He's at the bar, looks up into the mirror behind the bottles and sees a waitress working. My dad says to himself, "I am going to marry that girl."

That waitress was my mom. Much prettier than any human needed to be and the youngest girl with ten (10) older brothers. 

Which I want to point out the obvious: I am going to guess and say that none of her ten older brothers nor her parents were really that good of judge of character.  Because my dad, as you guess it, was a real piece of shit.

"But Joseph," you might exclaimed, "how can you say that? If your parents never met, you wouldn't be here today." You see, that's my point. If they had met, got married and lived happily forever after, then it would be a touching story.

But this touching, romantic story is bookended with depravity before and after that moment. My dad, being a piece of shit before meeting my mom, marries my mom, and becomes even worse since marries my mom. That's the part that doesn't make sense to me. I can question that meeting and marriage for the rest of my days. I am here right now--I am already born. I cannot change the past with my questions. 

My dad is dead and I haven't seen my mom since I was five. So unless my mom magically appears out of nowhere, I am probably not going to get answers to those questions anytime soon.

But man, when I hear what Job says in 3:16, "Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?" and the more I process my trauma, the more I get what Job was saying.

It would be better for me never to be born at all. I say this to say, if this is the life I was given, why could I have not been born?  Why didn't my mom didn't have better sense than to marry this fiendish fucker. What is her family like that they didn't do anything to protect her from this monster? 

God, I have so many questions about why am the fuck am I here? Why did you allow me to be born only to experience pain like this? And because of that pain, I will go on making stupid, ignorant, dumbfuck decision after decision and just sin all the more. I don't understand why was I born.

Because if it were up to me from what I know now? I might have not choose to be born.
