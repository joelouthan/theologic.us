&#8220;The art of building intimacy comes from two people being genuine and then telling each other the truth. That is how we are going to be free. That is how we are going to build strong marriages and strong families: everybody has permission to be themselves around me and I get to be myself around everybody else.

What I am not saying is that everybody gets to be an idiot. It&#8217;s not, &#8216;you&#8217;re ok and I&#8217;m okay.&#8217; Sometimes, you are acting selfish and evil and it needs to be okay to tell you, &#8216;you are acting selfish and evil&#8217; and how I am affected by that. I know you value me and you know I trust you.&#8221;
