Who is like you, my Lord?
Who is like my God?

The one who is my shield when fiery arrows have scorched the skies. The one who has called me righteous and equips me according to his own righteousness?
The one who has given me the speed to run to him in times of trouble? The one who has set me upon the mountaintop to see his awesome glory?
I have been trained but not by my own doing but by the teacher who will see my training till the end. I stand tall but not by my own strength but by the strength of your mighty hand. I have been made great but not my own pithy efforts but made great by your sweet gentle love, grace, and mercy.
My enemies, they have nothing on me. Their greatest numbers amass in vain. Their weapons cannot take my life. They battle without purpose because my King has soundly, completely, definitely, perfectly conquered them when He went to the cross and gave his life up so that I might live.
My foot presses against Death’s neck as I can hear his skull grind into the dirt beneath him. He waves at me but he has no power because he rules nothing.
You have given me this power. You alone have given me life.
I love you, Lord.
Amen

<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong>Series: </strong>As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very <em>personal and intimate nature</em> of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span>
