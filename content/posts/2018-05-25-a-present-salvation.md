<pre><blockquote>
  I adore thee for making me capable of knowing thee,
    for giving me reason and conscience,
    for leading me to desire thee;
  
  I praise thee 
    for the revelation of thyself in the gospel,
    for thy heart as a dwelling place of pity,
    for thy thoughts of peace towards me,
    for thy patience and thy graciousness,
    for the vastness of thy mercy.
</blockquote></pre>
