I am a man with little mercy. My life is filled with shame. My heart is ridden with cancerous sin. My will longs for the wide path well-traveled.

I cannot think I am better than a prideful man because I am that prideful man.

But you, O my Abba, have cleared one singular particular definite path to you and that is through your precious Son, my Christ my Savior and King.

If I am not humble, then please humble my soul. If my heart is hard, then take mine and give me yours. If sin crouches, then remove it from me and give me your Son’s righteousness.

To you, there is but one way. To life, fullness of joy, and pleasures evermore, there is only one way. To complete satisfaction, there is only one way and His name is Jesus Christ.

I run to you. Protect me.

God help me.

Amen.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong>Series: </strong>As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very <em>personal and intimate nature</em> of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span>
