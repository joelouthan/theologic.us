**Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.**

*What is the gospel?* Simply put, the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. It says so right there. You don't need me to expound on that. That's pretty simple.

The power of God for salvation:

- who God is
- power of God
- what did God do
- mere gospel 

Everyone who believes

- Distinction: Not to everyone
- Does not say "believes and does not believe"
- John 3:16 "whosoever believes and does not believe"
- Gospel *only* saves those who believe and trust Jesus Christ. Gospel does not save anybody who does not believe.

What does God do with his people

- elects His people
- calls to His people
- justifies His people
- saves them from their sin
- saves them from His wrath
- saves Him to himself
- redeems His people
- adopts His people as His children
- makes them co heirs with Christ 
- cleanses them from all unrighteousness
- conforms them into the likeness of His Son
- disciplines his kids
- keeps his kids
- glorifies his children

What does God do with unbelievers?
