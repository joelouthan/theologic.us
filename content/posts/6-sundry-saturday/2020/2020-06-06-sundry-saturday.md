## We Like Hockey

As an avid and rabid Dallas Stars fan, I think I speak for all of the hockey world when we were left scratching our heads over the dismissal of Jim Montgomery.

We thought we deserved answers. But just because we are the public doesn't mean we get know the truth at the expense of exposing one man's monsters. That needs to be dragged into the light of the Lord and not for the court of public opinion.

Coach Montgomery was a brave, brave man to come out and say what and why it happened.

That said, vocational ministers who fall from grace--it's not the same. Those who are called to pastor or teach or minister do so under authority (and I will argue both under God and additional leadership).  Those who are called are to love, care, and feed his lambs (John 21)--knowing full well if you lead them into sin, it would be better for you to be buried at the bottom of the ocean (Mark 9:42).  Also, rest assure, God promises he will take care of his lambs and will not hesitate to remove the false shepherds and replace them with his own (Jeremiah 23). We know this because Christ is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11).

## Real grace talk

I am surprised I am not hit with this crap on social media. I am less than a tick away from quitting it all and if I ever got spam like this, I would be THROUGH! But all is grace.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear p*rn accounts sneaking around the edges of my online space, a fair warning:<br><br>1. I am not available. 2. I pray for you. 3. God answers my prayers. 4. Some of you are going to get gloriously saved. 5. You will be *so happy* to feel *clean* again. <br><br>See you in church!</p>&mdash; Ray Ortlund (@rayortlund) <a href="https://twitter.com/rayortlund/status/1268198590796750850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
