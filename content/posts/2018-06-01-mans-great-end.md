<pre><blockquote>
  There is one thing that deserves my greatest care,
        that calls forth my ardent desires,
  That is, that I may answer the great end for which
      I am made —
    to glorify thee who hast given me being,
    and to do all the good I can for my fellow men;
  Verily, life is not worth having
    if it be not improved for this noble purpose.
</blockquote></pre>

&#8211; from _Man&#8217;s Great End_
