I honestly thought they would have done the right thing.

I honestly thought there would have been justice for Mike Brown and every other person of color who have been gunned down by the police.

But America has made it abundantly clear that we will remain a hateful, ignorant country.

On this day of Thanksgiving, I give thanks to God for the mercy and grace that He has given me.

May God have mercy on us all.
