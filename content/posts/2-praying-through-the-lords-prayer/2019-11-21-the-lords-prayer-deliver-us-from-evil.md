## Pray Then Like This

>Matthew 6:9-15 (CSB)
>“Therefore, you should pray like this:
>Our Father in heaven,
>your name be honored as holy.
>Your kingdom come.
>Your will be done
>on earth as it is in heaven.
>Give us today our daily bread.
>And forgive us our debts,
>as we also have forgiven our debtors.
>And do not bring us into temptation,
>but deliver us from the evil one.
>
>“For if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don’t forgive others, your Father will not forgive >your offenses.

## Deliver Us From Evil

>Matthew 6:13 And lead us not into temptation,  
>but deliver us from evil.

>James 1:13-15 (CSB) No one undergoing a trial should say, “I am being tempted by God,” since God is not tempted by evil, and he himself doesn’t tempt anyone. But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desire. Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.

My Rescuer,

Once, I was far from you. Assured of my own salvation based on what I did and nothing you have done. Yet, I sinned against you and others all the more.

I was dead. I had no life in my limbs. I had no strength to reach out to any passerby. I had no voice to call out for help because I had no breath. I was unknown. I was lost.

But you found me in the darkest hole and and the deepest ocean--beneath all of my anger, lust, wickedness, perversion, and treason. You found me cold and lifeless. You found me as a son of disobedience. You found me as a vessel of your wrath.

But you called me and you rescued me. And now I have life in you, Christ Jesus my Lord. Now, I move and dwell and have being in you alone. You have brought movement to my bones, light to my soul, and fire to my spirit. You brought me life, fullness of joy, and pleasures forevermore.

Keep me to yourself. Continue to rescue me from evil. Bring me home.

I love you. 

Amen.
