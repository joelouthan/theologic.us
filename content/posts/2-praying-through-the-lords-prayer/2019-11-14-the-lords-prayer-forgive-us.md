## Forgive Us--Help Us to Forgive

>Matthew 6:12 and forgive us our debts,  
>as we also have forgiven our debtors.

>Luke 23:32-34 (CSB) Two others—criminals—were also led away to be executed with him. When they arrived at the place called The Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided his clothes and cast lots.

## The Prayer

My Love and My Life

```text
Who is like you, God and who compares to you?

I know just a few things. You are holy and entroned on the praises of your people. I know that you are exalted far above all other gods.

And I know when when your Son joyfully, obediently, gladly, and in awe-struck power, nailed himself to that cross, He took all of my sins upon himself so that I would be with him forever.

Also, whatever sin and wrongdoing has been done to me, that belongs to your son as well.

Forgive my sins.

But my God, please forgive those who have sin against me.

Please saved them to yourself. Because you saved me and you are the only one who can save.

I worship you, Prince of Peace. I give you praise for all of my days.

Amen.
