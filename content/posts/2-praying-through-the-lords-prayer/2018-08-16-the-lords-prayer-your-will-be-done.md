## Pray Then Like This

>Matthew 6:9-15 (CSB)
>‚ÄúTherefore, you should pray like this:
>Our Father in heaven,
>your name be honored as holy.
>Your kingdom come.
>Your will be done
>on earth as it is in heaven.
>Give us today our daily bread.
>And forgive us our debts,
>as we also have forgiven our debtors.
>And do not bring us into temptation,
>but deliver us from the evil one.
>
>‚ÄúFor if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don‚Äôt forgive others, your Father will not forgive >your offenses.

## Your Will Be Done

>Ephesians 1:11-14 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Father
</div>

I am but a little kid. I see this, that Your will be done and my response is only what I want and concern for no one else. It is so easy for me to say, ‚ÄúI believe that the will of my Father will be done.‚Äù because I think I know your power and sovereignty.

Yet I am still on this earth and I know that I have needs and wants and desires and wishes. It is so easy to come to you and say, ‚ÄúGive me!‚Äù.

What if you said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  Will I have the wisdom and maturity to trust in you even when I don‚Äôt know why I am being protected for my own good?

What if you said, ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù  Will I have the patience and peace, not worrying or anxious, and wait for you?

Now, I say, ‚ÄúOf course I would have the wisdom, maturity, patience, and peace to handle that situation.‚Äù But at this moment now, nothing troubles my heart so it easy to say that.  But what about then?

Deep down inside, my faith will be tested and I have no guarantees that I would pass that test.

If Your will be done, then what can I really ask for?  How shall I pray for my heart to respond?

The only thing I do know is this:

You are my Father in heaven.

You alone are good and you can only do good.

You alone are loving and you can only love me.

You alone chose me, saved me and adopted me.  You are perfect, you cannot lose me because a Perfect Father does not lose His kids.  You cannot go back on your promises for it is impossible for you to break your own promise.

You alone are in charge. You alone dictate. You alone command.

You alone rule. You alone reign. You alone are sovereign.

You alone are holy. You alone are righteous. You alone are faithful.

You alone have the power to execute every single bit of your will.

You alone will receive all the majesty, honor and glory.

Just you. No one else.

Dad, you know my needs. You know my wants. You know my thoughts and dreams and I think I need this or that, but you know perfectly how to provide for me so that you alone receive all the glory.

You know my heart and as long as I am here on earth, you are constantly conforming me to the image of your Son.

If those things be true, then help me trust in You.

But even if my trust gives way, Lord, have your Holy Spirit gently and boldly remind me to consider others before myself. For you have me. You got me. I cannot be lost. I am going to be taken care of. You will bless me and keep me and because of what your Son has done, you said you will shine your face upon me, be ever so gracious to me, smile upon me and give me peace.

Because you have me, I am free to think of others and pray for them.

So this is my prayer: I lift them up to you, my gracious God.

Provide for them. Care for them. Heal them. Save them.

So many things that we want and we think they are good. We even think those good things come from you. Those things might be good or might not be good but it really does not matter. Lord, give us whatever would turn our hearts and affections towards You.  Do not give us over to the things of this world that would turn our backs towards You.  Our hope is in you alone. I pray for Your will to be done and that You will be glorified.

If it is by Your will, then I ask this one thing:

Lord, may I see Your glory?

For I know that I have these desires and I want these things to be done so bad.

So I come to You, as Your child, asking my Father ‚ÄúCan I please?‚Äù

But let me repeat, what my Eldest Brother said before, ‚ÄúNot my will but Yours‚Äù

‚ÄúNot mine but thine will be done.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt do this because I want to, do this because You want to.

Whatever Your will might be, let me be with you and rest in You alone.

Amen.
