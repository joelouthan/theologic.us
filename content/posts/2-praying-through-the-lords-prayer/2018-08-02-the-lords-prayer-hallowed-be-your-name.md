## Pray Then Like This

>Matthew 6:9 (CSB) “Therefore, you should pray like this:  
>Our Father in heaven,  
>your name be honored as holy.

## Hallowed Be Your Name

### God is holy

>Isaiah 6:1-4 (CSB) In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another:  
>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies;  
>his glory fills the whole earth.  
>The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke.  

### God is forever holy

>Revelation 4:8 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,
>
>“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,  
>who was and is and is to come!”

### We are set apart to Him

>Leviticus 20:26 (CSB) You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be mine.

### We are made holy because he is holy

>Isaiah 6:5-7 Then I said:  
>Woe is me for I am ruined  
>because I am a man of unclean lips  
>and live among a people of unclean lips,  
>and because my eyes have seen the King,  
>the LORD of Armies.  
>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth with it and said:  
>Now that this has touched your lips,  
>your iniquity is removed  
>and your sin is atoned for.

### Now we get to be holy because He is holy

>1 Peter 1:14-16 (CSB) As obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires of your former ignorance. But as the one who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your conduct; for it is written, Be holy, because I am holy.

### We are completely different than those who do not believe

>1 Peter 2:6-10 (CSB) For it stands in Scripture:  
>See, I lay a stone in Zion,  
>a chosen and honored cornerstone,  
>and the one who believes in him  
>will never be put to shame.  
>So honor will come to you who believe; but for the unbelieving,  
>The stone that the builders rejected—  
>this one has become the cornerstone,  
>and  
>A stone to stumble over,  
>and a rock to trip over.  
>They stumble because they disobey the word; they were destined for this.  
>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

### This call to holiness is the gospel to us

>1 Peter 1:22-25 (CSB) Since you have purified yourselves by your obedience to the truth, so that you show sincere brotherly love for each other, from a pure heart love one another constantly, because you have been born again—not of perishable seed but of imperishable—through the living and enduring word of God. For  
>All flesh is like grass,  
>and all its glory like a flower of the grass.  
>The grass withers, and the flower falls,  
>but the word of the Lord endures forever.  
>And this word is the gospel that was proclaimed to you.

## The Prayer

My Father

Because You are my good Father in heaven, I get to say this:

You are holy.

You are far above, far from all of my sin, and the sins of the world.

You shine the brightest.
  You are the most glorious.
  Your holiness is a fire unquenched. 
  Your holiness rejects and vomits out all of my trespasses.

Our sins,
  our trespasses,
  our wickedness,
  our transgressions
  and our iniquities keep us infinitely far for You.

Before You,
  we are complete strangers.

Before You,
  we are children who sit under Your just and necessary wrath.

Before You,
  we are dead.

Yet,
  oh how good and wonderful 
  that You sent Your Son
  across that infinite separation
  through the shattered cosmos
  and into our broken lives as Jesus Christ,
  Son of the Living God 
  to be not only fully God 
  but also fully man.

For it is Him who has made the way back to You!

Now that we get to be with You,
  Your Son shows us how to pray 
  and Your Spirit prays with us. 
  Apart from Your sovereign grace, 
  the bloodshed and broken body of Your Son on that cross 
  and the power of Your Spirit, 
  not only did I not know You 
  but I actively waged war against Your holy name.

But because Jesus Christ, 
Your Son, and my Savior, 
laid out the path to You, 
I get to enjoy Your presence. 
Because of Your Son’s life, death and resurrection,
the absolute truth is that
we get to fully enjoy You forever and ever.

And because of Your Spirit’s awesome power,
  You claim us to be Yours forever.

You have always known me 
  and You will always know me. 
  You will not forget me nor forsake me. 
  You have always loved me and you will always love me. 
  You are so good to me and you will not stop being good to me.

How glorious is Your Name!

Amen.
