<pre><blockquote>
  I think of thy glory and my vileness,
    thy majesty and my meanness,
    thy beauty and my deformity,
    thy purity and my filth,
    thy righteousness and my iniquity.
  Thou hast loved me everlastingly, unchangeably,
    may I love thee as I am loved;
  Thou hast given thyself for me,
    may I give myself to thee;
</blockquote></pre>

&#8211; from _Christ is All_
