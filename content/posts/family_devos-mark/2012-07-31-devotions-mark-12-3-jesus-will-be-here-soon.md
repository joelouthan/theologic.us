**Mark 1:2-3 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
  
“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
  
who will prepare your way,
  
the voice of one crying in the wilderness:
  
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,
  
make his paths straight,’”**

500 years before Jesus came as a little baby, the entire Old Testament spoke of Jesus Christ.

Jesus said it himself:

**And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, Christ interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. Luke 24:27**

_Can you think of any place in the Old Testament that was similar to Jesus? What about David, Ruth, Solomon, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Isaiah?_
