And people came and said to him, “Why do John&#8217;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.”**

_1. Is Jesus with us physically like you are with me or your mom is with me at this dinner table?_

Jesus is physically not here. He is with us in spirit (through the Holy Spirit) but he is in heaven ruling and reigning, personally mindful of us all and praying for each of us.

_2. Is Jesus coming back?_
  
**Matthew 24:23-31 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.** **“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.**

_3. Does your mom misses me when I am away? Do I miss your mom when I am not with her?_

The more I love your mom, the more I miss her when I am not with her. Think: if we choose to love God and God grows in us, don&#8217;t you think we will want to see him more and more?

_What if Jesus came back to get us before you got out of school? Before you got married? Before you had kids of your own? What if he came back before I could ever preach? What if Jesus came back before we got to anything we wanted to do?_

_4. How should we wait for Jesus?_

Until we see Christ face to face, what should we do?

Fast (Esther 4:16, Ezra 9:5, Luke 18:9-14]
  
Pray (Matthew 6:5-15)
  
Love one another (1 John 3 &#8211; 5)
  
Give (2 Corinthians 8 &#8211; 9)

_5. What is the number one thing we are to do until he gets back?_

Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:14-20, John 21:15-19, Acts 1:6-8

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
