**Mark 1:12-13 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.**

_Was Jesus human?_

_Was Jesus the Son of God?_

_Did Jesus have in him, the Spirit of God?_

_Do we have the Spirit of God?_

_Are we sons and daughters of God?_

**Romans 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.**

_Does God love his kids?_

_Does God love you?_

**Parents**: After talking about the person and work of the Holy Spirit, now the opportunity presents itself to talk about "_What does that mean to me?_", "_What does it mean to have the Holy Spirit within my heart?_" or "_What does it look like to be led by the Spirit of God?_". If further discussion is needed, a great starting off point is Galatians 5:22-23 "The Fruit of the Spirit".
