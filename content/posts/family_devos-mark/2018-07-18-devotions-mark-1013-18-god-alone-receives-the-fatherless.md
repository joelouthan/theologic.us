  <span class="s1">Mark 10:13-16 <strong>And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.</strong></span>

  1. What place do children have within church?
  2. What do you think Christ meant by receiving the kingdom of God like a child?
  3. We come into the kingdom like children but are we to stay like children and act like children or do we grow and mature?
