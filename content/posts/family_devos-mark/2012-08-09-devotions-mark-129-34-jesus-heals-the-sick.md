Now Simon&#8217;s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.**

**That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.**

_Who made our bodies?_
  
**Genesis 1:26-27
  
Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”**

**So God created man in his own image,**
  
 **in the image of God he created him;**
  
 **male and female he created them.**

_Were our bodies suppose to get hurt? Were we suppose to get sick?_
  
**Genesis 2:31a And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good…**

_Why do we get sick? Why do we get bad dreams? Why does our tummies hurt? (Genesis 3]_

_Who comes to heal the sick, take away our hurts and give us brand new life?_
  
If God heals you in this house, that is of God.

_If you are healed when you take medicine, where did the medicine come from?_

If you are healed when you go see the doctor, nurse or even go to the hospital, where did all doctor and nurses&#8217; smarts come from? Where did money to build the hospital come from?

God heals.

_What if we die here on earth, do we still live?_
  
If we trust, believe in Christ, we will live in perfect happiness with Him forever. That is faith.

**Colossians 1:15-20
  
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
