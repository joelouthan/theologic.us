**Mark 7:31-37 Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”**

1. This should not surprise anybody that God can heal the deaf and the mute. But why did Jesus perform this miracle.

2. After speaking at length with the Pharisees, it appears that they would not hear Jesus. For us to hear God, does God have to do something first?

**1 Corinthians 2:9**
  
 **But, as it is written,**
  
 **“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,**
  
 **nor the heart of man imagined,**
  
 **what God has prepared for those who love him”—**
