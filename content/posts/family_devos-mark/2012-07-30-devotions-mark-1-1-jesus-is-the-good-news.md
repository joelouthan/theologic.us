>Mark 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

`Lets go through this grand introduction, idea by idea.`

## The beginning

`Who wrote Mark?`

`Who is Mark`
  
Mark is said to be the writer for Peter

`What does Mark write about?`
  
Mark testifies about Christ Jesus

Each of the Gospels tells a different perspective about Jesus:

- **Matthew** - Jesus is King (Lion of Judah)
- **Mark** - Jesus is Servant (The Ox)
- **Luke** - Jesus is Man (The Human)
- **John** - Jesus is God (The Eagle)

In Mark, we are going to talk about all that Jesus did (like a Servant, like a hard working ox) for us, in us, and through us for the glory of God.

## of the gospel

`What is the gospel?`

This is the good news—that God has done everything to save His people to Himself forever. All we need to do is trust in Him, believe in Him and love Him and know that everything He does is for His glory and our joy. If God is not out for His glory, we are never free to have joy. But since He is for His glory and His name sake and not just for us, we have the fullness of the freedom to love, worship and trust in Him joyfully. The Bible is not a bunch of rules. The Bible is all about Jesus Christ. The Bible speaks on who exactly God is, what He has done and what He will do.

The real question is:

`Do you want in on the fun? Do you wanna come play and be in continuous awe, wonder, joy and love of His glory? Come on. Let's go!`

## Jesus Christ

What we will see in Mark is basically little bitty tightly wounded passages that speak of all that God has done. Now, if you have read any part of the Old Testament, these little passages in Mark are merely the OT in bite size chicken nuggets, except they are much more tasty and actually good for you. In other words, you are going to see these little passages of "Jesus did this" and "Jesus did that" solidifying what God did in the OT.

`Who is Jesus Christ?`

## Son of God

Ah what an audacious claim. In America, some of us were not blessed with good dads that love Jesus. Some of us got dads that were not so perfect and sometimes, there is a struggle not to compare God as Father in light of our earthly dads when in fact it should be the other way around. As we might struggle with that, the culture of the Middle East struggles with Jesus Christ as being the Son of God. That is highly offensive to them. How could Jesus Christ claim to be the Son of God. For Christ to be the Son of God is Christ declaring He is One with the Father.

>John 10:30 I and the Father are one.

Yet, as Athanasius (early church father) so boldly declare:

>>The Son of God became man so that men might become sons of God.

`What does it mean to be a son of God?`

`Are you an adopted son of God?`

`Are you his kid?`

If you believe and trust in Him, what He said, what His Son did, then yes, you are his little kid—forever.
