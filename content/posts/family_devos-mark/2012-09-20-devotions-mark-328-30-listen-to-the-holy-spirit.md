**Mark 3:28-30 “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—for they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” **

_What is blasphemy?_

Saying that God is something not when He is (i.e. goodness, faithfulness, just, loving, etc.) or saying that God is something when he is not (i.e. evil, wicked, capricious/whimsical, etc.).

_What if you said Father is something or Jesus is something bad, will you be forgiven if you trust in God?
  
_ Luke 22:54-62; John 21:15-19

_Why do we always respect and be nice to your Mom? What does your Mom do for you?_

_Who is the Holy Spirit? What does He do for you? What would it mean to blaspheme the Holy Spirit? Why can that not be forgiven?</p>

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
