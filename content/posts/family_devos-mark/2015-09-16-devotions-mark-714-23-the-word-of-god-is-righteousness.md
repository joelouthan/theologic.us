**Mark 7:14-23**
  
**And he called the people to him again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart but his** stomach, **and is expelled?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.) And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”**

1. Can we do anything to that would make us evil, bad, or clean?

2. According to Jesus, where does evil come from?

3. Is the evil that we do makes us evil?

4. Is it the good that we do makes us good?

5. Who makes us good? Who gives us good hearts?
