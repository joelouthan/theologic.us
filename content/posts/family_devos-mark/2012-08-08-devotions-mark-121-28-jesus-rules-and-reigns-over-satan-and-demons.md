And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.** 

Be confident in God&#8217;s Word. If the Bible says it, it is as good as gold. It is as good as done. (See 2 Timothy 3:16-17)

**And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.”** 

_Do the demons know who God is?_ 

_Do the demons know that Jesus is Lord God Almighty?_

_Do you believe in God?_

_Do you believe everything He says?_

**But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.**

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.

_Who is the Lord over heaven?_

_Who is the Lord over earth?_

_Who is the Lord over hell?_

Satan is not in charge of anything except demons. Christ is charge of everything. When Christ died on the cross, Satan, demons, hell, sin and death were defeated at that moment.

**Parents**: This is where we talk about the supremacy of God. We do not live in a dualistic universe where the forces of good battle against the force of evil. We live in the kingdom of God where Christ has claimed victory over Satan, death (Heb 2:14], demons (Col 2:15), hell (Phil 2:9-11] and sin (Heb 7:27).
