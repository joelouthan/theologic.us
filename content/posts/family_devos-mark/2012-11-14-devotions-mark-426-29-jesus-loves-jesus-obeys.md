Mark 4:26-29 **And he said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground. He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how. The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”**

1. _What do we need to do for God to grow inside of our hearts or for us to grow in God?_

Only to trust and obey God.

Here is a tough question: &#8220;Kids, do you obey us because you love us or because you are afraid of getting into trouble?&#8221;

** For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
  
and chastises every son whom he receives.”
  
It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.**
  
(Hebrews 12:6-8 ESV)

We do not want you to obey God out of &#8220;something we must do&#8221; or &#8220;if we don&#8217;t obey God, he will punish us&#8221; but rather, out of a love for God.

_Retell the story of David&#8217;s life and then list out his desires in Psalm 119_

2. _The seed makes fruit without the farmer. Does it mean that the farmer can stop farming? God works to grow your heart for Him. Does it mean we can stop being Christians?_

**I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.**
  
(1 Corinthians 3:6-7 ESV)
