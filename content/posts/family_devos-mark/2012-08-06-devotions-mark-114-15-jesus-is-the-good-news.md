**Mark 1:14-15 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”
  
** 
  
_1. Is the kingdom of God right here, right now?_

_What is the kingdom of God? Is it like a country like the United States—does it have a location? Does it include all of the earth, all of heaven and all of outer space?_

_Does it have a leader?_

_Who lives in the kingdom of God?_

2. _What does it mean to repent?_

_What does it mean to turn away from sin and turn towards God?_

_What does it mean to trust in God?_

3. _What is the gospel? Tell me some of the things you think the gospel of God is._

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
