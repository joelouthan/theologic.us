And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.” And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.**

_1. What is prayer?_
  
Worship
  
Talking
  
Giving Thanks

_2. Why do we pray?_
  
We get to talk to our Father in heaven. We get to spend time with him. We get to kick it.

_3. When you don&#8217;t get to see your dad, do you miss him? When Jesus was here on earth, do you think he missed his Father?_

 **Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”**
  
 **(Matthew 26:36 ESV)**

**And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”**
  
 **(Matthew 26:39 ESV)**

**Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”**
  
 **(Matthew 26:42 ESV)**

**So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again.**
  
 **(Matthew 26:44 ESV)**

**And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.**
  
 **(Mark 1:35 ESV)**

**And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray.**
  
 **(Mark 6:46 ESV)**

**But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.**
  
 **(Luke 5:16 ESV)**

**In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God.**
  
 **(Luke 6:12 ESV)**

**Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.**
  
 **(Luke 9:28 ESV)**

**Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”**
  
 **(Luke 11:1 ESV)**

**When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,**
  
 **(John 17:1 ESV)**

_4. How come we get to talk to the God?_
  
Because of everything Christ has done for us.

_5. Do you think Jesus helps us pray?_
  
**“And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.**

 **“And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this:**

 **“Our Father in heaven,**
  
 **hallowed be your name.**
  
 **Your kingdom come,**
  
 **your will be done,**
  
 **on earth as it is in heaven.**
  
 **Give us this day our daily bread,**
  
 **and forgive us our debts,**
  
 **as we also have forgiven our debtors.**
  
 **And lead us not into temptation,**
  
 **but deliver us from evil.**

 **For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.**
  
 **(Matthew 6:5-15 ESV)**

_6. Do you think Jesus prays for us?_
  
**I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.(John 17:9 ESV)**

**Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.**
  
 **(Romans 8:34 ESV)**

_7. Do you think the Holy Spirit helps us pray?_
  
**But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.**
  
 **(John 14:26 ESV)**

**Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.**
  
 **(Romans 8:26 ESV)**

_8. Do you think the Holy Spirit prays for us as well?_
  
**And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.**
  
 **(Romans 8:27 ESV)**

Just like Jesus always wanted to spend time with His Dad, we get to spend time with our Dad in Heaven. We get to call out to him like you guys call out your daddy. God will always have time to spend with you. He is never busy. He will always listen. You can just start talking and he hears you perfectly fine. Even if you can&#8217;t speak, he can read your thoughts and see what&#8217;s on your heart. He will always answer prayers:

**I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;**
  
 **incline your ear to me; hear my words.**
  
 **(Psalm 17:6 ESV)**

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
