And other boats were with him. And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?” And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”**

_Who is God over the seas, air, and the ground?_

_Loud thunder, lightening, heavy rain, darkness, coldness, and in the middle of the sea: if you were in the same situation that these guys in, without Christ, would you consider yourselves in trouble?_

_But who is God over our troubles?_

_Name some of the ways not to be afraid._

At the end, the guys said to one another, &#8220;Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?&#8221;.  _Who is Jesus? Who do you think Jesus is?_

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
