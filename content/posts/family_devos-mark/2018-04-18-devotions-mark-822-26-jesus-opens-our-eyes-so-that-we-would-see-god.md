> Mark 8:22–26 And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” And he looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking.” Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. And he sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”

Is it even possible to see God without God?

How do we get to see God and his goodness?

If we cannot see it, how are we able to see God? What can we do?

Is it possible to truly know God without the help of God? Could we study and go to a lot of church and go to Bible school and really know God?
