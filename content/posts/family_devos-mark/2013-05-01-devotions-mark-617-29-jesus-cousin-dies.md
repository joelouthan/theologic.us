Mark 6:17-29** For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife.” And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.**

**But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias&#8217;s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” And she went out and said to her mother, “For what should I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.” And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#8217;s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.**

1. _Who was John the Baptist?_

&nbsp;

2. _What did he say about himself?_

**     And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”**
  
(John 1:19-23 ESV)

&nbsp;

**     He must increase, but I must decrease.”**
  
(John 3:30 ESV)

&nbsp;

3. _What is the one thing that John had to do in this life?_

&nbsp;

4. _What did Jesus say about John?_

**     Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force.**

**     For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.**

**     “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,
  
“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
  
we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’
  
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.”**
  
(Matthew 11:11-19 ESV)

**     Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.**
  
(Matthew 5:12 ESV)

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
