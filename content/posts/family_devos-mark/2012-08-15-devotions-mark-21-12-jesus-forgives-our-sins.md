And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, “Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you question these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.” And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”**

_1. Can God truly forgive us? Can we be truly healed?_

The cross of Christ is the power to forgive sin and cure our diseases
  
**Surely he has borne our griefs**
  
 **and carried our sorrows;**
  
 **yet we esteemed him stricken,**
  
 **smitten by God, and afflicted.**
  
 **But he was pierced for our transgressions;**
  
 **he was crushed for our iniquities;**
  
 **upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,**
  
 **and with his wounds we are healed.**
  
 **All we like sheep have gone astray;**
  
 **we have turned—every one—to his own way;**
  
 **and the LORD has laid on him**
  
 **the iniquity of us all.**
  
**(Isaiah 53:4-6 ESV)**

_2. When God completely removes our sin and we are with God, can we be hurt or sick again? Can we die again?_

**He will swallow up death forever;**
  
 **and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces,**
  
 **and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth,**
  
 **for the LORD has spoken.**
  
**(Isaiah 25:8 ESV)**

_3. What has sin done to our lives? What has sin done to life?_

**Genesis 2:16-17; Genesis 3:1-21; Romans 3:10-12; Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23**

_4. What will Christ end up doing in order to forgive us of our sins?_

**Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9:22-10:18**

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
