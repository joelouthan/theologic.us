And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”**

_How many people were here with John? _

Jesus &#8211; **was baptized by John**
  
Holy Spirit &#8211; **descending on him like a dove
  
** Father &#8211; **a voice came from heaven**

_Is Jesus God? Is the Father God? Is the Holy Spirit God? _

Yes

_How many persons who are God? _

Three

_How many God(s) are there?_

One

_If there are three people and just one God, how can all three persons be one God?_

**Parents: **On the surface, the doctrine of the Trinity is the most confusing because we really don&#8217;t have anything on earth like it. I believe it was Augustine who said:

> Three persons in this room does not have one will.  Triune God does have one will.

The best way I explained the Triune God to my kids is explaining how my wife and I try to have one will but we do so imperfectly. That is why my wife and I have to talk all the time especially when it comes to connecting, becoming one, parenting, and running the house. Mom and Dad have to do talk all the time and sometimes we are not perfect in having one will—even less so when it comes to do the Father&#8217;s will.

However, the Father, Son, and Spirit communicate perfectly, know perfectly, love perfectly, and therefore have one perfect will. They never have to argue, fight, or disagree. They can certainly discuss anything (and Father and Son do) but they all want the same thing and want the same way to get to that same thing. (This is most evident by the cross of Christ.)

_What would it mean to be perfectly love each and perfect agree with one another? To have three persons with one mind, one heart and one will?_

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
