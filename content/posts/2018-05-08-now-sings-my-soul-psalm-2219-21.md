<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almighty God,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are you, my Lord, whose glory fills the entire earth? Whether I am in the heavens or make my bed in hell, you are there with me. If I ascend the mountain of your glory or wander in the desert of the wilderness, you are face to face and closer than a whisper.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My God, you are never far! You are with me! Always. While I might feel desperate or despair sadness or anger or happiness, you are with me and within me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are at work in my soul and heart. Because you are at work, I know that it is you that gives me true life and the fullness thereof. For once I was lost, now found. Blind, now I can see. Deaf, now can hear. Mute, now preach your gospel. Ignorant of unbelief, now I know you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once dead, now fully alive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve sent your Son to die in my place for my sins so I can be with you. His cross is where my enemies were trampled underfoot and their teeth shattered. It is his empty grave where the bulls’ necks are broken by burying my sin and to stay buried forevermore.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You alone are worthy of my praise. Blessed be your name forever!.</span>

<span style="color: #999999;"><b>Series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very personal and intimate nature of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.</span></i></span>
