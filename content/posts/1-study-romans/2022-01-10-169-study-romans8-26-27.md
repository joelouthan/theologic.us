## The Introduction

So you are saved by God and now you are a new creation. But what if you sin again? Will God change his mind about you?

Is it on you and your efforts

## The Text

>Romans 8:26-27 (CSB)  
><sup> 26 </sup> In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. 

><sup> 27 </sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

## Our God

><sup> 26 </sup> In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. 

### God is always for us: the Spirit helps us in our weakness--because we are weak

### God is always for us: we don't what to pray for as we ought

### God is always for us: the Spirit intercedes for us

>Galatians 3:1-6 You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? 2 I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? After beginning by the Spirit, are you now finishing by the flesh? 4 Did you experience so much for nothing â€” if in fact it was for nothing? 5 So then, does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law? Or is it by believing what you heard â€” 6 just like Abraham who believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness?
