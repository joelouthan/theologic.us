## The Introduction

## The Text

>Romans 9:14-29 (CSB) What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
>
>You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?” On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory— on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? As it also says in Hosea,
>
>I will call Not My People, My People,  
>and she who is Unloved, Beloved.  
>And it will be in the place where they were told,  
>you are not my people,  
>there they will be called sons of the living God.
>
>But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,  
>Though the number of Israelites  
>is like the sand of the sea,  
>only the remnant will be saved;  
>since the Lord will execute his sentence  
>completely and decisively on the earth.
>
>And just as Isaiah predicted:  
>If the Lord of Hosts had not left us offspring,  
>we would have become like Sodom,  
>and we would have been made like Gomorrah.

## The Support

God saves whom he will save.

That is the takeaway.

And there are three responses.

One is of apathy. "Okay. So what?" I am not hear to speak to you.

The second typical response of rebellion. "That's unfair." You are the one that Paul is addressing here. God is Almighty. God is the only one who can save. And he does save. And we know this because Jesus Christ came to live, die, rose from death, and ascended to the right hand of the Father. God rules and reigns over all creation.

The third response is "where shall we go?". If God is the only one who can save and we are in desperate need of being saved from our sins, to whom can we run to?

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

>Luke 11:5-13 (CSB) He also said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I don’t have anything to offer him.’ Then he will answer from inside and say, ‘Don’t bother me! The door is already locked, and my children and I have gone to bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’ I tell you, even though he won’t get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his friend’s shameless boldness, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
>
>“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”

## The Gospel

Guess what? If you turn to God, go to God, run to God, ask for God, guess what you are getting in return?

God.

It is futile to give a second thought to whether you are predestined to salvation and one of the elect. It is like my old seminary professor, Sinclair Ferguson, said, "You can argue and debate about predestination all the days of your life but unless you have placed your hope, trust, belief, faith and obedience in Jesus Christ, you are not saved. I don't care how predestined you think you are. You are not saved by predestination alone. You are not saved by elect alone. We are only saved by Christ alone."

## Our Responsibility

Guess what we are to? Place our hope, trust, belief, faith, and obedience in Christ Jesus. That is it. That is the responsibility. That is what the gospel of Christ has called us to do.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
