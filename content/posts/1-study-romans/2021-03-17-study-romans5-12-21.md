## The Introduction

## The Text

>Romans 5:12‚Äì21 (CSB)  
><sup> 12 </sup> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned. 

><sup> 13 </sup> In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to a person‚Äôs account when there is no law. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam‚Äôs transgression. He is a type of the Coming One. 

><sup> 15 </sup> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man‚Äôs trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many. 

><sup> 16 </sup> And the gift is not like the one man‚Äôs sin, because from one sin came the judgment, resulting in condemnation, but from many trespasses came the gift, resulting in justification. 

><sup> 17 </sup> If by the one man‚Äôs trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. 

><sup> 18 </sup> So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is justification leading to life for everyone. 

><sup> 19 </sup> For just as through one man‚Äôs disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man‚Äôs obedience the many will be made righteous. 

><sup> 20 </sup> The law came along to multiply the trespass. But where sin multiplied, grace multiplied even more 

><sup> 21 </sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## The Support

>1 Corinthians 15:20-22 (CSB) But as it is, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man. 22 For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

God is the better Man.

God rules and reigns over all of creation.

>Colossians 2:13‚Äì15 (CSB) And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

Christ, the Son of God, who is God, has "disgraced" Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death "publicly" or as the ESV puts it, "to open shame". How? "God triumphed over them in Him."

While we are on this subject, you must understand that God does not lose. He always win. He is triumphant. He gets all the worship and praised due. He gets this alone for just being the Triune God. And then he creates the heavens and the earth. And then He creates Mankind. Man sins against God. But yet, God preaches the gospel. He saves his people. By how? Openly shaming Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death. For whom? For all who believe in His Son shall not perish but have eternal life.

## The Gospel

Here is the good news: Christ now rules and reigns over sin and death!

>John 11:34‚Äì44 (CSB) ‚ÄúWhere have you put him?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúLord,‚Äù they told him, ‚Äúcome and see.‚Äù
>
>Jesus wept.
>
>So the Jews said, ‚ÄúSee how he loved him!‚Äù But some of them said, ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt he who opened the blind man‚Äôs eyes also have kept this man from dying?‚Äù
>
>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. ‚ÄúRemove the stone,‚Äù Jesus said.
>
>Martha, the dead man‚Äôs sister, told him, ‚ÄúLord, there is already a stench because he has been dead four days.‚Äù
>
>Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?‚Äù
>
>So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, ‚ÄúFather, I thank you that you heard me. I know that you always hear me, but because of the crowd standing here I said this, so that they may believe you sent me.‚Äù After he said this, he shouted with a loud voice, ‚ÄúLazarus, come out!‚Äù The dead man came out bound hand and foot with linen strips and with his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúUnwrap him and let him go.‚Äù

Through just bleakness. Nothing darker. Nothing deeper. Nothing more depressing. Nothing more opposite of God. Death. All of sin results in death. And Lazarus was not immune to this. Christ knew it.

When we refer to "righteous anger", we always refer to Christ flipping over tables and remark, "See, it is okay to be upset and occasionally flip over tables." Then we go about our days trying so hard not to get so upset.
What if flipping tables was not Jesus at his angriest? I can tell you it was not.

This. Right here. Christ was so full of anger, sadness, and grief because Death took one more loved one away. Christ could have had the last word--he was heading to the Cross. But in his righteous anger and sadness, He decides to do something right now. He commands Death to stand down and he calls Life into a person that belong to Him forever.

Because of the sin of our original father, Adam, sin and death reigned and ruled over all of of mankind.

Because of the righteousness of Christ who was joyfully obedient to the point of death--even death on the cross, his people were saved from their sins and death.

We have put our trust in the one who has championed over Death. Christ Jesus is his name!

It is an absolute fact: "You shall name Him, Jesus, for he will save His people from their sins."

## Our Responsibility

### Preach the good news: receive the good news

>1 Corinthians 15:1-11 (CSB) Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received

### Preach the good news: take a stand in the good news by which you are being saved

>on which you have taken your stand 2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.

### Preach the good news: that Christ came into the world to save sinners

>3 For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. 6 Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me.

### Preach the good news: You and I are never too far from the infinite arm of the Almighty God who saves!

>For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

### Preach the good news: This is the grace of where you are at now--what do you want to do?

>10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.

### Preach the good news: in whatever you do, do so that others might believe and trust the Lord Jesus Christ!

>11 Whether, then, it is I or they, so we proclaim and so you have believed.


### Preach the good news: Christ is our life

Christ is not simple Lord over sin and death and demons and hell. That is only one little part of the good news.

Christ is Lord over  life. Let's hear what Christ says about it.

>John 11:20-27 (CSB) As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary remained seated in the house. 21 Then Martha said to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn‚Äôt have died. 22 Yet even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.‚Äù
>
>23 ‚ÄúYour brother will rise again,‚Äù Jesus told her.
>
>24 Martha said to him, ‚ÄúI know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.‚Äù
>
>25 Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live. 26 Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?‚Äù
>
>27 ‚ÄúYes, Lord,‚Äù she told him, ‚ÄúI believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who comes into the world.‚Äù
