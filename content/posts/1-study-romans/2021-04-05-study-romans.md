## The Text

>Romans 8:35-36 (CSB) Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written:
>
>Because of you  
>we are being put to death all day long;  
>we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.

## The Support

>Acts 17:24-28 (ESV) The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, for  
>“‘In him we live and move and have our being’;  
>as even some of your own poets have said,  
>“‘For we are indeed his offspring.’

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

God is above our circumstances and God does not lose his children.

>John 10:25–30 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me, but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## The Gospel

>Romans 10:8–17 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

## Our Responsibility

Obey the gospel.

Life is hard. This is Genesis 3 through and through.

That doesn't give us a way out.

You know what I find fascinating about God and his gospel and our church culture today? We have overly emphasized that women should do everything right in order to prevent men from being tempted into sin. Our church has told women over and over again, "You need to do everything perfectly so that men don't sin." I find that fascinating for two reasons. One, when Adam was filled with sin and death, how does Adam respond? Blames Eve.

But God doesn't blame Eve.

Two, we can read Proverbs 6 and think, "Oh it is on the women not to tempt because we men are just dumb ox." That is foolishness. Don't be worthless in your thinking. Again, blaming someone else for your own sin is the curse of being a son of Adam. Don't you know? The better son of Adam, who came into our world, hung out with the prostitutes and cheating wives and thieving tax collectors and **redeemed them** not because they blamed their environment, circumstances, and temptations, but rather, **admitted their desperate need for a great Savior.**

What did Jesus promised the thief next to him as they were both crucified?

>Luke 23:39-43 (ESV) One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

You, me, the thief, all of us are in a real desperate need of the only God who can save us from sin and death. That God is Jesus Christ.

Do you fear God? Do you think that you will stand audaciously before God and out of your mouth say, "Oh yea, God, I lusted after that woman because she was wearing a low-cut blouse."

What you think God is going to say? "Oh yea, that's cool. Whelp, you're free to go." Nah. If you do not repent of your sins, the same Christ that was crucified for the sins of believers is the same exact Christ who is the judge of the living and dead will utter these words, "Be gone from me, you workers of lawlessness."

Don't get tossed into hell for circumstances and the world.  Trust in God right now.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Precious Love
</div>
&nbsp;

Today, I will stop blaming others, the world, circumstances or the times we live in.

I am to blame for all of my sins.

But I trust in you alone. And here is my sin. You died on the cross to take my sin. So here is my sin.

Give me your righteousness.

Amen.
