## The Introduction

## The Text

>Romans 8:27 (CSB) And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## The Support

>Genesis 3:8-10 (CSB) Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
>
>And he said, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”

>1 Samuel 16:7 (CSB) But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or his stature because I have rejected him. Humans do not see what the LORD sees, for humans see what is visible, but the LORD sees the heart.”

>1 Chronicles 28:9 (CSB) “As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever.

>Jeremiah 20:12 (CSB) LORD of Armies, testing the righteous and seeing the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to you.

>Psalm 139:23 (CSB) Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.

>Jeremiah 17:10 (CSB) I, the LORD, examine the mind, I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve.

If God can see our hearts and know our deepest desires and thoughts, why would we try to hide from him?

We tried to hid from him because we are burden with guilt and shame from our sins.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?**

## God

Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God because God alones sees the hearts of man.

But why hide from him when he is the only God who can cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

>1 John 1:9-10 (CSB) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say, “We have not sinned,” we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

He already declared "No Condemnation!".

How can he be so sure about you? How can he be so sure about me? I see my own heart and I am disgusted. And then I cannot see everything about it and gross sin still pops up. What can I even do?

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## The Gospel

>Ezekiel 11:19-20 (CSB) I will give them integrity of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and practice them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.

Again and again, I will tell you the same thing. If you get tired of it, too bad, it is the gospel. It is the only thing that I can say that has any worth or value.

God declares no condemnation over you. God is quick and faithful to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The fact we can confess and repent is a supernatural work of God--it is not the natural work of man.

I will take it one step further:

Because God swapped your heart for his, he speaks tenderly to us:

>Hosea 2:14 (CSB) Therefore, I am going to persuade her, lead her to the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.

Because God swapped your heart for his, he rejoices over you with gladness--he will delight in you with singing!

>Zephaniah 3:17 (CSB) The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing.”

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Our Responsibility

If you are in Christ, then your old sinful-ridden heart has been yanked out.  God the Father puts his heart into you.

When the Spirit searches hearts, he sees his own heart and intercedes for you, the saint, according to the will of God.

What is ours to do? Turn to him quickly. Ask God to search out your heart and find any sin left over.

>Hebrews 12:3–11 (CSB) For consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, so that you won’t grow weary and give up.  In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.  And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: My son, do not take the Lord’s discipline lightly or lose heart when you are reproved by him,  for the Lord disciplines the one he loves and punishes every son he receives.  Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline?  But if you are without discipline—which all receive—then you are illegitimate children and not sons.  Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live?  For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness.  No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.

The Lord is quick to cleanse you because you have his heart. You are his own and you are so very precious to him. Turn to him and let him do his work.

My God

Give me your Spirit, your soft heart, and your Son, so that I will be quick to confess and you will be quicker to cleanse me from all unrighteousness.

Amen.
