## The Introduction

## The Text

>Romans 11:33-36 (CSB)  
>Oh, the depth of the riches  
>and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!  
>How unsearchable his judgments  
>and untraceable his ways!  
>For who has known the mind of the Lord?  
>Or who has been his counselor?  
>And who has ever given to God,  
>that he should be repaid?  
>For from him and through him  
>and to him are all things.  
>To him be the glory forever. Amen.

**Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?**

## God

>Ephesians 3:16-19 (CSB) I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power in your inner being through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love, and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

>Colossians 1:15-20 (CSB) 
>He is the image of the invisible God,  
>the firstborn over all creation.  
>For everything was created by him,  
>in heaven and on earth,  
>the visible and the invisible,  
>whether thrones or dominions  
>or rulers or authorities—  
>all things have been created through him and for him.  
>He is before all things,  
>and by him all things hold together.  
>He is also the head of the body, the church;  
>he is the beginning,  
>the firstborn from the dead,  
>so that he might come to have  
>first place in everything.  
>For God was pleased to have  
>all his fullness dwell in him,  
>and through him to reconcile  
>everything to himself,  
>whether things on earth or things in heaven,  
>by making peace  
>through his blood, shed on the cross.

## The Gospel

>Colossians 1:21-23 (CSB) Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him— if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become a servant of it.

## Our Responsibility

The gospel is not, "Have you figured it out yet."

The gospel: believe and trust in the Lord.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
God
</div>
&nbsp;

You are a great mystery.

Yet, you have revealed yourself by sending your Son, Jesus Christ.

And we now *truly* know you by the power of your Holy Spirit.

Reveal yourself to us and turn our hearts towards you.

Amen.
