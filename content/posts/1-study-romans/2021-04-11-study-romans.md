## The Text

>Romans 10:1-13 (CSB) Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation. I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them. But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, “Who will go up to heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down or, “Who will go down into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead. On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim: If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame, since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

## The Support

This is as straight forward of a passage as it gets.

I think some, like myself, who are zealous for the word of God and in turn, get excited over the book of Romans, have a tendency to break up Romans into bits. First, Romans 1-8 speaking about our salvation. Second, 9 to 11 talking about Israel. Third, 12-16 some practical application.

But, according to what we have been told in Romans so far:

- all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God
- the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
- there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
- there is no separation from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord
- not all who are born related to Abraham are sons of Abraham
- only those with faith of Abraham are sons of Abraham

But if I am convinced that what Paul wrote in Scripture was the theologically explanation of the ministry and the words of Jesus Christ was here on earth, then reading from Genesis to Romans, I think a very sane question to ask is:

"Why do people still refuse to believe the gospel?"

And if you are carefully paying attention, the real question is this:

"How come Israel is so blind to the gospel--even when they had Christ in their midst?"

My entire point is this: Let Romans 1 through 11 speak on the salvation of the people of God--Jews and Gentiles alike.

But I digress.

>Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation. I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness.

Real salvation is not going to come by the fact you will be able to ace a theological quiz. That is not salvation. Real salvation from your worst sins and in the presence of a loving Savior is not going to come by you working hard or appearing godly. No!

## God

>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them. But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, “Who will go up to heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down or, “Who will go down into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.

>Matthew 5:17-18 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished.

>Luke 4:17-21 (CSB)
>The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written:  
>The Spirit of the Lord is on me,  
>because he has anointed me  
>to preach good news to the poor.  
>He has sent me  
>to proclaim release to the captives  
>and recovery of sight to the blind,  
>to set free the oppressed,  
>to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.
>
>He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him. He began by saying to them, “Today as you listen, this Scripture has been fulfilled.”  

>Isaiah 55:10-11 (CSB)  
>For just as rain and snow fall from heaven  
>and do not return there  
>without saturating the earth  
>and making it germinate and sprout,  
>and providing seed to sow  
>and food to eat,  
>so my word that comes from my mouth  
>will not return to me empty,  
>but it will accomplish what I please  
>and will prosper in what I send it to do.”  

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## The Gospel

>On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim: If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame, since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him.

## Our Responsibility

Again:

>For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

## Pray

Save me.

Amen.
