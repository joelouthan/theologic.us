## The Text

>Romans 4:13–25 (CSB) For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made empty and the promise nullified, because the law produces wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.
>
>This is why the promise is by faith, so that it may be according to grace, to guarantee it to all the descendants—not only to the one who is of the law but also to the one who is of Abraham’s faith. He is the father of us all. As it is written: I have made you the father of many nations— in the presence of the God in whom he believed, the one who gives life to the dead and calls things into existence that do not exist. He believed, hoping against hope, so that he became the father of many nations according to what had been spoken: So will your descendants be. He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body to be already dead (since he was about a hundred years old) and also the deadness of Sarah’s womb. He did not waver in unbelief at God’s promise but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, because he was fully convinced that what God had promised, he was also able to do. Therefore, it was credited to him for righteousness. Now it was credited to him was not written for Abraham alone, but also for us. It will be credited to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

## The Support

>Matthew 5:17–20 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.

>Luke 24:25–27 (CSB) He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and enter into his glory?” Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures.

>Romans 8:1–4 (CSB) Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

## God

God alone fulfills his promise.

Contrary to assumed thought, the law was not born out of the sin of mankind. In other words, Adam & Eve disobeyed and then God is up in the heavens scrambling away and trying to figure out how the write Genesis to Deuteronomy. That's not what happened.

You wanna what happened. When mankind fell, they didn't get how far they were from the presence and the intimacy of God? They didn't get it and we certainly didn't get it today.  Imagine the entirety of the law of God was a set number representing the distance between man and God since Genesis 3.

The hubris of man sometimes looks at God in two ways:

- "Oh yea, that's doable." I swear I love Oklahoma with all of my heart and soul and this is how you guys act.
- On the other end of the spectrum, which is me for most of my life, "It's too hard so why even try" and I proceed to sin to the fullest.

The truth: do the math on the distance between God and man according to the law and that distance is always infinite.

Fun math fact: infinity minus one equals infinity. It is not that our 1, 2, 1000, or 1000000 is anything worth while. In comparison to the uncountable number of infinity, it measures as nothing. It doesn't chip away. It doesn't make the number low. It doesn't move the needle.

That infinite distance of God from man is what we call the holiness of God.

>Isaiah 6:1–4 (CSB) In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another:
>
>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies;  
>his glory fills the whole earth.  
>
>The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke.

Holy, holy, holy is the God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## The Gospel

Both of the historical responses of man towards God have been foolish. So don't be foolish.

In order for you to bridge the infinite gap between God and man, you will need something that is infinite.

But a thing won't do it.

You are going to need someone infinite between God and man to fill that gap. What man can do this since we very much finite beings with a definite beginning and an end?

Who can bridge that gap for us?

Or as Paul is going to say later in the Romans 7: "Wretched man that I am! Who will save me from this body of death?"

## Our Responsibility

Or as Isaiah responded further in Isaiah 6:

>Isaiah 6:5 (CSB) Then I said:  
>Woe is me for I am ruined  
>because I am a man of unclean lips  
>and live among a people of unclean lips,  
>and because my eyes have seen the King,  
>the LORD of Armies.  

Look at how Jesus Christ himself:

>John 12:41 (CSB) Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him.

responds to the prophet Isaiah:

>Isaiah 6:6–7 (CSB) Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth with it and said:
>
>Now that this has touched your lips,  
>your iniquity is removed  
>and your sin is atoned for.  

Isaiah confesses his sin. How does our lovely, gentle, and lowly God with an immeasurable heart from sinners responds?  With the removal of sin.

>Ephesians 2:1–10 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Confess your sins all the time. All the time God will draw closer. Don't know how? No need to despair. God will bridge that gap because He has already bridged that gap to you with his only begotten son, Jesus Christ. And THEN Jesus sends His Spirit to mark you as his. God covers the gap twice to save you. It is the double portion that is given to you as a heir of promise for eternal life.
