## The Text

>Romans 8:31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## The Support

If God is for us, who can be against us? I will use the words of Paul and what he says about the believer thus far in Romans:

Romans 1 - The gospel of God is for everyone who believes; for the unbeliever, God turns them over to a debased mind

Romans 2 - God's kindness is meant for our repentance

Romans 3 - Everybody is unrighteous and far from God. No exceptions.

Romans 4 - You cannot earn your way to God

Romans 5 - Christ died for sinners, not for the righteous

Romans 6 - We don't get to sin

Romans 7 - We will struggle but God helps out

Romans 8:1 - No condemnation

Romans 8:2 - We are alive in Christ

Romans 8:3 - Christ fulfills the law

Romans 8:4 - only for those who walk according to the Spirit

Romans 8:5-10 - This is an black and white issue. Either you are in Christ or in his wrath. There is no in-between.

Romans 8:11 - Spirit gives life to believers because He resurrect Christ from the dead

Romans 8:12 - We are not obligated to sin

Romans 8:13 - By the Spirit, we get to kill off sin

Romans 8:14 - We are sons of God

Romans 8:15 - We get to call on the Father

Romans 8:16 - The Spirit testifies that we are children of God

Romans 8:17 - We are co-heirs with Jesus Christ

Romans 8:18-25 - We will suffer but we hope in Christ

Romans 8:26 - We are weak, Spirit is our strength and He intercedes for us

Romans 8:27 - God sees our hearts and Spirit intercedes according to the will of God

Romans 8:28 - Anything that you have done or has been done to you will be redeemed by God

Romans 8:29 - God promises he will make you look like his Son

Romans 8:30 - Because God is perfect, his glorification of his people is already done in Christ Jesus

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

God is for us.

So if God is for us, who can be against us? We have already teased out how God saves his people. Not a magic wand but through blood and water and action and calling and voice and doing. Not in logic but in who He is. There are no loopholes. There are no gotchas. There are no spiritual tripwires with God.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## The Gospel

The gospel of Christ calls us to obey Christ. How? Repent and trust in Him.

You are going to mess up. You are going to fail. Christ already saw that--remember Romans 5:8. He saw that you were a sinner and he died for you. 

Christ didn't die for his people for the possibility of you turning to him. No. Predestinated, called, justified, and glorified you on the Cross.

"What? I don't get a choice in the matter." I will let you debate that question with your friends. But let me go ahead and settle that argument: dead people can't choose.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Our Responsibility

If you believe in Christ, you are no longer dead in your sins.

If you trust in Christ, you are now fully alive. 

>1 John 5:1 (CSB) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him.

>John 1:12-13 (CSB) But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

There is nothing standing against you. God has fixed everything.

You are not obligated to the world. So stop listening to the world on what is good and evil and permitted and not permitted. God is the standard, not the world.

You are not obligated to listen to Satan. And here are straight facts: he is gunning for you and he will try his best to take you down. And he might win a battle or 1000. But God has already won. Satan is a defeated foe. He was put to open shame by the cross of Christ.

You are not obligated to your self. What you think you should do or ought to do, unless it is in Christ, you don't gotta do jack squat.

>Matthew 8:18-22 (CSB) When Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave the order to go to the other side of the sea. A scribe approached him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
>
>Jesus told him, “Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
>
>“Lord,” another of his disciples said, “first let me go bury my father.”
>
>But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

Or let me put in modern terms:

"Lord, let me lay my life down for you but I want to get married, I want to do my own thing, I want to be successful, I don't want to be hurt, I don't want to be betrayed, I don't want to suffer, I don't want to be disciplined."

Hey. Christ is telling you, "Count the cost of following Him." What is stopping you? But if you are in Christ, there is nothing against you: nothing in heaven, hell, or earth. Nothing.

The excuses have been dismissed. What are you going to do?
