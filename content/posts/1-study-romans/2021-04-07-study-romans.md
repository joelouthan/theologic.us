## The Text

>Romans 8:38-39 (CSB) For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## The Support

>1 Corinthians 15:12-19 (CSB) Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say, “There is no resurrection of the dead”? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is in vain, and so is your faith. Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified wrongly about God that he raised up Christ—whom he did not raise up, if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Those, then, who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished. If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone.

## God

Let me contend to you that God has spelled out precisely what His love is all about—that is, it was all about Jesus Christ his Son.

The birth, life, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Christ is the love of God manifested to us all. Believe in him, trust in him, and obey him and you will have eternal life.

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## The Gospel

>John 3:12-21 (CSB) If I have told you about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven —the Son of Man.
>
>“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Anyone who believes in him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. This is the judgment: The light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids it, so that his deeds may not be exposed. But anyone who lives by the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God.”

## Our Responsibility

>Ephesians 3:14-21 (CSB) For this reason I kneel before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power in your inner being through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love, and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
>
>Now to him who is able to do above and beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us— to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

But if I am honest with myself, my belief, trust, and love for God waivers. I get distracted. I have let the world wear me down. Here’s a frightening thought: what if God’s love was solely based on my own love for Him?

That thought terrifies me because I can do nothing perfect. Ever.

But by the sheer grace of God, I do not have to be.

Let me fall away seven million times, but I am counted righteous unto him and get up seven millionth and one more.

Let all of life wear me down. And then watch the Father come running after me to rescue me yet again that I might live to Him.

Let death come knocking on my door.

> > But yet, Death is a defeated foe because my Savior championed over Death. I will step on Death’s prostrated neck and spring forth to glory and perfect relationship with God.
> >
> >Octavius Winslow. No Condemnation In Christ. Banner of Truth. 385.

Let angels, rulers, and powers come at me! For my Christ Jesus is the Commander of the Most High and the Grand Champion and Conqueror over Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death. He is my shield, my sword, strong tower and mighty fortress. I shall not be moved!

Let circumstances fall where they may. There is nothing that I have done or will ever do that would reconstruct the eternal chasm between God and myself. Why? Jesus Christ fills the void and is the measure and distant between the eternal God and me.

My God ascends to glory far above and away from my sins. Yet, despite the dark depths of my sin and depravity, my Christ Jesus went deeper still to eradicated my sins once and for all.

Let the cosmos fall. Let this planet be torn asunder. Let the unthinkable happen. My Lord is Lord above all and in his hand are power and might over all.

Nothing, absolutely nothing will separate me from God’s love for me that only comes through Jesus Christ my precious Lord and Savior. Amen.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Covenant Love
</div>
&nbsp;

Right in this moment  
  come and rescue me.

Deliver me out of all of my sin  
  change my mind on all things  
  let behold your glory  
  let me see your face  
  grant me repentance!  
  So I can turn to you  
  and be with you  
  and you with me  
  forever.

Bring me home to you  
  in your timing  
  but while I am here  
  I will do your will.

But I need your sovereign grace  
  I will need your Son  
  and the fullness of your Spirit  
  to obey your word.

Keep me close  
  never let me go.

Amen.
