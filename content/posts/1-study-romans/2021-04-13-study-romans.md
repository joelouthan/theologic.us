## The Text

>Romans 11:1-10 (CSB) I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he pleads with God against Israel? Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life! But what was God’s answer to him? I have left seven thousand for myself who have not bowed down to Baal. In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace. Now if by grace, then it is not by works; otherwise grace ceases to be grace.

>What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened, as it is written,  
>God gave them a spirit of stupor,  
>eyes that cannot see  
>and ears that cannot hear,  
>to this day.

>And David says,  
>Let their table become a snare and a trap,  
>a pitfall and a retribution to them.  
>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,  
>and their backs be bent continually.

## The Support

>1 Corinthians 2:10-16 (CSB) Now God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, since the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except his spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God. We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people. But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually. The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, and yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone. For

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## God

Again, we can debate about free will and single and double predestination. We can even debate Israel and the church. But I am telling you that Romans 9, 10, 11 are not about that.

The Scriptures are all about Jesus (Luke 24:27). If that is being the case, then what does this passage say about God?

It has a lot less to do with us and more about who He is.

And this is going to repeat what we said in throughout the Romans study: salvation belongs to God alone for he is the mighty one to save. He is the only one who can save us.

I don't care what your eschatology (end-times) theology is. You can give me all the charts and graphs and verses out of context. What I can tell you is that not all of Israel is saved. They are not automatically saved just because they are Jewish. Just like none of us are saved by being born in a Christian home.

God says so right here: I kept some to me. And for others, I have:

- The rest were hardened, as it is written,  
- God gave them a spirit of stupor
- eyes that cannot see
- and ears that cannot hear
- to this day

Just like in Romans 1:18-32, God will give us over to our sin. In our foolishness and rebellion, we have seen it not only in the Bible but in our own lives and the lives around us: he will give us over to our own hardened hearts.

## The Gospel

Here is the gospel: I don't care if you have been given over to sin. I don't care if your heart has been hardened by God. That is not a final judgment for you. Why do I know? You are still breathing God's air. You are still alive on this earth. And that is his kindness and grace. And that kindness was meant for your repentance:

>Romans 2:3-8 (CSB) Do you think—anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same—that you will escape God’s judgment? Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed. He will repay each one according to his works: eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality; but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness.

It is never too late to believe what God has says and obey. It is never to late to repent! The kingdom of God is right now because Christ has done it all to save His people from their sins.

## Our Responsibility

Repent of our sins today. Confess. Remind ourselvs of his great gospel. Believe and call upon the name of the Lord and you will be saved!

>Romans 10:9-13 (CSB) If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame, since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Our Lord our Savior
</div>
&nbsp;

Give us repentance right now to confess and turn over our sins to you so that we will live in your presence forever.

Give us your Spirit so that we might have life and life more abundantly.

Give us more of Christ and strip ourselves. Make him supreme and only in our lives so the rest of the world will grow strangely dim to our bleared eyes.

Help us. Save us. We need you.

Amen.
