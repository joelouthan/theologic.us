## The Text

>Romans 5:12–21 (CSB) Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned. In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to a person’s account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression. He is a type of the Coming One.
>
>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many. And the gift is not like the one man’s sin, because from one sin came the judgment, resulting in condemnation, but from many trespasses came the gift, resulting in justification. If by the one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
>
>So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is justification leading to life for everyone. For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous. The law came along to multiply the trespass. But where sin multiplied, grace multiplied even more so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## The Support

>1 Corinthians 15:20–28 (CSB) But as it is, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man. For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
>
>But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be abolished is death. For God has put everything under his feet. Now when it says “everything” is put under him, it is obvious that he who puts everything under him is the exception. When everything is subject to Christ, then the Son himself will also be subject to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.

## God

God is the better Man.

God rules and reigns over all of creation.

>Colossians 2:13–15 (CSB) And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

Christ, the Son of God, who is God, has put Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death "to open shame" (ESV) and disgraced them publicly. How? "God triumphed over them in Him."
While we are the subject, God does not lose. He always win. He is triumphant. He gets all the worship and praised due. He gets this alone for just being the Triune God. And then he creates the heavens and the earth. And then He creates Mankind. Man sins against God. But yet, God preaches the gospel. He saves his people. By how? Openly shaming Satan, demons, sin, hell, and death. For whom? For all who believe in His Son shall not perish but have eternal life.

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## The Gospel

Again, for all those who believe in the Son of God will not perish but have everlasting life.

>John 11:34–44 (CSB) “Where have you put him?” he asked. “Lord,” they told him, “come and see.”
>
>Jesus wept.
>
>So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” But some of them said, “Couldn’t he who opened the blind man’s eyes also have kept this man from dying?”
>
>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. “Remove the stone,” Jesus said.
>
>Martha, the dead man’s sister, told him, “Lord, there is already a stench because he has been dead four days.”
>
>Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?”
>
>So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me. I know that you always hear me, but because of the crowd standing here I said this, so that they may believe you sent me.” After he said this, he shouted with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” The dead man came out bound hand and foot with linen strips and with his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unwrap him and let him go.”

Through just bleakness. Nothing darker. Nothing deeper. Nothing more depressing. Nothing more opposite of God. Death. All of sin results in death. And Lazarus was not immuned to this. Christ knew it.

When we refer to "righteous anger", we always refer to Christ flipping over tables and remark, "See, it is okay to be upset and occasionally flip over tables." Then we go about our days trying so hard not to get so upset.

What if flipping tables was not Jesus at his angriest? I can tell you it was not.

This. Right here. Christ was so full of rage because Death took one more loved one away. Christ could have had the last word--he was heading to the Cross. But in his righteous anger and sadness, He decides to do something right now. He commands Death to stand down and he calls Life into a person that belong to Him forever.

You shall name Him, Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.

## Our Responsibility

>1 Corinthians 15:1–19 (CSB) Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received, on which you have taken your stand and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me.
>
>For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether, then, it is I or they, so we proclaim and so you have believed.
>
>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say, “There is no resurrection of the dead”? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is in vain, and so is your faith. Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified wrongly about God that he raised up Christ—whom he did not raise up, if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Those, then, who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished. If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone.
