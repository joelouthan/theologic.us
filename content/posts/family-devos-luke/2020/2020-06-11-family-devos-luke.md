Luke 4:1–13 (CSB) Then Jesus left the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness  for forty days to be tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were over, he was hungry.  The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”  But Jesus answered him, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone.”  So he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  The devil said to him, “I will give you their splendor and all this authority, because it has been given over to me, and I can give it to anyone I want.  If you, then, will worship me, all will be yours.”  And Jesus answered him, “It is written: Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.”  So he took him to Jerusalem, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.  For it is written: He will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you,  and they will support you with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.”  And Jesus answered him, “It is said: Do not test the Lord your God.”  After the devil had finished every temptation, he departed from him for a time.

Hebrews 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
