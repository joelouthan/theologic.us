## The Lord Heals

Luke 4:38‚Äì40 (CSB) After he left the synagogue, he entered Simon‚Äôs house. Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked him about her.  So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and began to serve them.  When the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with various diseases brought them to him. As he laid his hands on each one of them, he healed them.

Can we trust God to heal us if we are sick?

In what ways does God heals us? What about doctors, nurses, medicine, or science? Are they from God?

## The Lord Delivers

Luke 4:41 And demons also came out of many, crying, ‚ÄúYou are the Son of God!‚Äù But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

Psalm 37:40 (CSB) The Lord helps and delivers them; he will deliver them from the wicked and will save them because they take refuge in him.

John 10:28‚Äì29 (CSB) I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.  My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father‚Äôs hand.

If we believe in Jesus, what evils are we being delivered from?

Then what are being delivered to?

## The Lord Saves

Luke 4:42‚Äì44 (CSB) When it was day, he went out and made his way to a deserted place. But the crowds were searching for him. They came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them.  But he said to them, ‚ÄúIt is necessary for me to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose.‚Äù  And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.

Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù
