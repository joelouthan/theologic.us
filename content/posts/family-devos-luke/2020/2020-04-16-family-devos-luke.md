Luke 2:22‚Äì24 (CSB) And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were finished, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord  (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord)  and to offer a sacrifice (according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons).

```text
Did Christ perfectly obey the law of God?

Why was this necessarily so?

Did Christ learn the law of God automatically or was he taught?

Out of all* *the people Jesus knew as a child, who would have taught Jesus the most Scriptures?
