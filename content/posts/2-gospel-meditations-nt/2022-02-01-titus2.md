## The Text

>Titus 2 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> But you are to proclaim things consistent with sound teaching. 

><sup> 2 </sup> Older men are to be self-controlled, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance. 

><sup> 3 </sup> In the same way, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking. They are to teach what is good, 

><sup> 4 </sup> so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children, 

><sup> 5 </sup> to be self-controlled, pure, workers at home, kind, and in submission to their husbands, so that God’s word will not be slandered. 

><sup> 6 </sup> In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled 

><sup> 7 </sup> in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity in your teaching. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that any opponent will be ashamed, because he doesn’t have anything bad to say about us. 

><sup> 9 </sup> Slaves are to submit to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back 

><sup> 10 </sup> or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything. 

><sup> 11 </sup> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 

><sup> 12 </sup> instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, 

><sup> 13 </sup> while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 

><sup> 14 </sup> He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Proclaim these things; encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
