## The Text

>2 Timothy 3:13â€“17 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> Evil people and impostors will become worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

><sup> 14 </sup> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you, 

><sup> 15 </sup> and you know that from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 

><sup> 16 </sup> All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, 

><sup> 17 </sup> so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
