## The Text

>Titus 3 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, 

><sup> 2 </sup> to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people. 

><sup> 3 </sup> For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. 

><sup> 4 </sup> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 

><sup> 5 </sup> he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. 

><sup> 6 </sup> He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior 

><sup> 7 </sup> so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life. 

><sup> 8 </sup> This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone. 

><sup> 9 </sup> But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, because they are unprofitable and worthless. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning. 

><sup> 11 </sup> For you know that such a person has gone astray and is sinning; he is self-condemned. 

><sup> 12 </sup> When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, because I have decided to spend the winter there. 

><sup> 13 </sup> Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Let our people learn to devote themselves to good works for pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. 

><sup> 15 </sup> All those who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
