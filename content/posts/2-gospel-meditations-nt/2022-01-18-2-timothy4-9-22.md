## The Text

>2 Timothy 4:9–22 (CSB)  
><sup> 9 </sup> Make every effort to come to me soon, 

><sup> 10 </sup> because Demas has deserted me, since he loved this present world, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you, for he is useful to me in the ministry. 

><sup> 12 </sup> I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 

><sup> 13 </sup> When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus, as well as the scrolls, especially the parchments. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Watch out for him yourself because he strongly opposed our words. 

><sup> 16 </sup> At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be counted against them. 

><sup> 17 </sup> But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that I might fully preach the word and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth. 

><sup> 18 </sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 

><sup> 19 </sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 

><sup> 20 </sup> Erastus has remained at Corinth; I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. 

><sup> 21 </sup> Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. 

><sup> 22 </sup> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
