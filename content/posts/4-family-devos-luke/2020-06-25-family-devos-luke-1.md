**Luke 4:38–40 (CSB) After he left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked him about her.  So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and began to serve them.  When the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with various diseases brought them to him. As he laid his hands on each one of them, he healed them.**
