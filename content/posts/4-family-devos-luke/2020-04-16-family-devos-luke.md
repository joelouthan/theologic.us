Luke 2:22–24 **And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”**

*Did Christ perfectly obey the law of God?*

*Why was this necessarily so?*

*Did Christ learn the law of God automatically or was he taught?*

*Out of all* *the people Jesus knew as a child, who would have taught Jesus the most Scriptures?*
