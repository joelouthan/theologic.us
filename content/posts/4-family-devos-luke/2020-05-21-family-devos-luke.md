**Luke 3:1–6 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,**

**“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:** 
**‘Prepare the way of the Lord,** 
**make his paths straight.** 
**Every valley shall be filled,** 
**and every mountain and hill shall be made low,** 
**and the crooked shall become straight,** 
**and the rough places shall become level ways,**

*Who is the last prophet of the Old Testament?*

*Why was John the Baptist’s ministry so important?*

*What was John’s mission?*

*How is our calling exactly like John’s?*
