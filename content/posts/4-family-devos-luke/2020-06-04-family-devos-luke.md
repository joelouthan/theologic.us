**15 As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ, 16 John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”**

*Who is the Christ?*

*Can John the Baptist be the Christ? Why or Why not?*

*Can John judge the living and the dead?*

*How is the mission of John similar to the commission that Christ has given us?*
