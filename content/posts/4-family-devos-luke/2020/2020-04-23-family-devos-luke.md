​Luke 2:25–33 (CSB) There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking forward to Israel’s consolation, and the Holy Spirit was on him.  It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he saw the Lord’s Messiah.  Guided by the Spirit, he entered the temple. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform for him what was customary under the law,  

Simeon took him up in his arms, praised God, and said,

    Now, Master, 
    	you can dismiss your servant in peace, 
    	as you promised.
    For my eyes have seen your salvation.  
    You have prepared it 
    	in the presence of all peoples—  
    	a light for revelation to the Gentiles 
    	and glory to your people Israel.

His father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.

*How do you think Simeon felt see and holding the Christ?*

*Have you ever received a prophetic word?*

*Has it come to pass?*

*Examine Simeon's worship. What did Simeon equate Jesus to?*
