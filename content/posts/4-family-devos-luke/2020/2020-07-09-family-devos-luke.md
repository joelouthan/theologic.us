## Jesus Rests

Luke 6:1-11 (CSB) On a Sabbath, he passed through the grainfields. His disciples were picking heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.<sup> 2 </sup>But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
<sup>
3 </sup>Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David and those who were with him did when he was hungry—4 how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat? He even gave some to those who were with him.”<sup> 5 </sup>Then he told them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
<sup>
6 </sup>On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled.<sup> 7 </sup>The scribes and Pharisees were watching him closely, to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could find a charge against him.<sup> 8 </sup>But he knew their thoughts and told the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand here.” So he got up and stood there.<sup> 9 </sup>Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you: Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”<sup> 10 </sup>After looking around at them all, he told him, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored.<sup> 11 </sup>They, however, were filled with rage and started discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.

*What is the Sabbath?*

Genesis 2:1–3 (CSB) So the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.<sup> 2 </sup>On the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.<sup> 3 </sup>God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it he rested from all his work of creation.

*If God commands us to take a day of rest, what do you think your other days of the week will look like?*

*What is your favorite way to rest and have fun?*

## Jesus Prays

Luke 6:12 (CSB) During those days he went out to the mountain to pray and spent all night in prayer to God.

*What is prayer?*
<sup>
1 </sup>Thessalonians 5:16–22 (CSB) Rejoice always,<sup> 17 </sup>pray constantly,<sup> 18 </sup>give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.<sup> 19 </sup>Don’t stifle the Spirit.<sup> 20 </sup>Don’t despise prophecies,<sup> 21 </sup>but test all things. Hold on to what is good.<sup> 22 </sup>Stay away from every kind of evil.

*How can you pray all the time? Is that even possible?*

*How can you talk to God all the time? How do you talk to your dad, mom, sister, brother, cousin, best friend all the time?*

## Jesus Calls

Luke 6:13-16 When daylight came, he summoned his disciples, and he chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles:<sup> 14 </sup>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;<sup> 15 </sup>Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;<sup> 16 </sup>Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

*How does Jesus choose his people?*

Ephesians 1:3–6 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ.<sup> 4 </sup>For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him.<sup> 5 </sup>He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,<sup> 6 </sup>to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.

*Why would Jesus choose any of us? Is it because we were good or because we were sinners?*

Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

## Jesus Heals

Luke 6:17-19 (CSB) After coming down with them, he stood on a level place with a large crowd of his disciples and a great number of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.<sup> 18 </sup>They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those tormented by unclean spirits were made well.<sup> 19 </sup>The whole crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing them all.

*How can Jesus heal us?*

*Who is the one who made us?*

*Is the only reason why Jesus came to us is to heal us?*
