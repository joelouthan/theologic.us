**Luke 3:18–20 So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people. But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.** 

*Do all people like good news?*

*Will people try to stop you from talking about Jesus?*
