​		**Luke 3:18–20 (CSB) Then, along with many other exhortations, he proclaimed good news to the people.  But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the evil things he had done,  Herod added this to everything else—he locked up John in prison.** 

*If we tell others of the good news of God, will all people love to hear it or will some hate it?*

**2 Corinthians 2:14–17 But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. 15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 16 to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? 17 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God’s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.**
