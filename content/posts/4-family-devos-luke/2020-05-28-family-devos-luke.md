​		**Luke 3:7–14 (CSB) He then said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?  Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance. And don’t start saying to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.  The ax is already at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”  “What then should we do?” the crowds were asking him.  He replied to them, “The one who has two shirts must share with someone who has none, and the one who has food must do the same.”  Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”  He told them, “Don’t collect any more than what you have been authorized.”  Some soldiers also questioned him, “What should we do?” He said to them, “Don’t take money from anyone by force or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.”** 

*According to John, what is the mark of a person who believes and trusts in God?*

*What is difference between doing the law and loving God?*
