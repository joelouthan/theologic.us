**Luke 2:25–33 Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,** 

<pre><b>  “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, 
  	according to your word; 
  	for my eyes have seen your salvation 
  	that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, 
  	a light for revelation to the Gentiles, 
  		and for glory to your people Israel.” </b></pre>

**And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.**

*How do you think Simeon felt see and holding the Christ?*

*Have you ever received a prophetic word?*

Has it come to pass?

*Examine Simeon's worship. What did Simeon equate Jesus to?*
