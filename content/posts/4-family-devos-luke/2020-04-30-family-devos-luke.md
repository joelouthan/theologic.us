**Luke 2:34–38** **And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”**  

​		**And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.** 

*According to Simeon, what did Jesus come to do? Where can we point in the Gospels where Christ himself speaks of the same thing?*

*Read John the Baptist's prophecy in John 3:25-30 and then consider all the prophets of the OT including Anna and John. What did all the prophets do?*
