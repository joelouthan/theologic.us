**Luke 2:39–40 And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.**

*What do you think it means for Christ to be fully human--to grew and became strong, filled with wisdom--yet, Jesus was also fully God?*
