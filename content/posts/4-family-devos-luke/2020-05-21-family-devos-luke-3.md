​		**Luke 3:15–17 (CSB) Now the people were waiting expectantly, and all of them were questioning in their hearts whether John might be the Messiah.  John answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I am is coming. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.  His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out.”** 

*Can John the Baptist be the Christ?*

*What makes Jesus Christ the Savior of the world?*
