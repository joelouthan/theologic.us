​		**Luke 2:41–52 (CSB) Every year his parents traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.  When he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival.  After those days were over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.  Assuming he was in the traveling party, they went a day’s journey. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.  When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.  After three days, they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.  And all those who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers.  When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”  “Why were you searching for me?” he asked them. “Didn’t you know that it was necessary for me to be in my Father’s house?”  But they did not understand what he said to them.  Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother kept all these things in her heart.** 

**And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and with people.** 

*Was Jesus being disobedient to his parents?*

*What can we surmise from his passage about the relationship between God the Father and God the Son?*

*Can we ever hope to have a relationship like that?*

*Because of Christ, what sort of relationship can we have with the Father?*
