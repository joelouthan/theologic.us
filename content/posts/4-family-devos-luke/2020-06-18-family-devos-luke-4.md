**Luke 4:31–37 (CSB) Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.  They were astonished at his teaching because his message had authority.  In the synagogue there was a man with an unclean demonic spirit who cried out with a loud voice,  “Leave us alone! What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”  But Jesus rebuked him and said, “Be silent and come out of him!” And throwing him down before them, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.  Amazement came over them all, and they were saying to one another, “What is this message? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”  And news about him began to go out to every place in the vicinity.**
