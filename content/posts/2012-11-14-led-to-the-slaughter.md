<pre>Expose our prideful motives, throw them away
And clothe us with humility as You displayed
We all have sought a savior in garbage heaps
Lift us out from the wreckage, become our King

<em>Born into this world like us
A humble human form
Pouring Himself out as an offering
God became just like a lamb led to the slaughter</em>

Expose our prideful motives, throw them away
Present us in Your purity in these twisted days

May we not seek false saviors 
in worthless things
Collapse our knees beneath us, 
You are our King

Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
<em>You’re the King and source of true righteousness.</em>
</pre>
