I will not attempt to explain way this atrocity. Similar to when our Patristic leaders had to make up words in order to explain the Incarnation of God, so too I will not do a disservice to Eric Garner&#8217;s life by explaining away theologically.

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
  <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='372' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT66U_Ftdng?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
</div>

I will say this: this is one of the many countless ways that Christ came to make right. It&#8217;s not good right now but Christ promises he will make it good. Christ promises that he is with those who are grieving at the loss of life. I don&#8217;t know how but I trust in God more so than I trust broken humans fixing this crap.

I am sorry, Mr. Garner. I am sorry Mrs. Garner. I am so sorry.
