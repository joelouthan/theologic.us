> Then there’s the reality that holiness is plain hard work, and we’re often lazy. We like our sins, and dying to them is painful. Almost everything is easier than growing in godliness. So we try and fail, try and fail, and then give up. It’s easier to sign a petition protesting man’s inhumanity to man than to love your neighbor as yourself. It’s one thing to graduate from college ready to change the world. It’s another to be resolute in praying that God would change you.

Kevin DeYoung. [_The Hole in Our Holiness: Filling the Gap Between Gospel Passion and the Pursuit of Godliness_][1]. Crossway, 2012. 19.
