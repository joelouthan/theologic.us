(Psalms 27:7-10)
  Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;
be gracious to me and answer me!
  You have said, Seek my face.
My heart says to you,
Your face, Lord, do I seek.
  Hide not your face from me.
Turn not your servant away in anger,
O you who have been my help.
Cast me not off; forsake me not,
O God of my salvation!
  For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
but the Lord will take me in.

 

</pre>
