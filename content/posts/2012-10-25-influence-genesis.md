(I logically suspect that that other one time is simply because I am a novice scholar.)

Forgive me as I do this off the top of my noggin but if I am not mistaken, all Biblical doctrines originates in Genesis in a _very direct way_. [<sup>1</sup>][2]{#return-note-1105-1.simple-footnote}

Doctrine of creation: Genesis 1 & 2

Doctrine of the _imago Dei_ (or the theological, doctrinal, logical, empirical, rational reason why it is pure ignorance for you to be a racist): Genesis 1:27

Doctrine of _sola fide _is easy. Genesis 15:1-6 because Paul in Romans 4:4-5 references it.

Doctrine of marriage: Genesis 2:25

Hmm, let me try something more __organized like _ordo salutis:_

**Love** &#8211;  Genesis 1:1, Genesis 3:21

**Election** &#8211; Genesis 6:8; Genesis 12:1-3

**Vocation** &#8211; Genesis 12:1-3, Genesis 17:19

**Justification** &#8211; Genesis 32:22-32

**Atonement** &#8211; Genesis 22:13

**Propitiation** &#8211; Genesis 15:1-31; Genesis 22:13

**Expiation** &#8211; Genesis 15:1-31; Genesis 22:13

**Sanctification** &#8211; Genesis 37:2-36; Genesis 39-41:36

**Glorification** &#8211; Genesis 41:37-50:26

That worked out rather easy.

I am convinced that any topic or passage preached in the Bible can be have a passage in Genesis as a starting bullet point.

Hence, it what makes Genesis so _weighty _with truth and doctrine and preaching through Genesis would be no small task.

Of course, this would be for naught except Christ has revealed how he complete the thoughts begun in Genesis.

Luke 24:27 **And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. **
