**BRAG POST:** If my calculations are correct, [yesterday](https://theologic.us/family-devos-luke/2020-05-07-family-devos-luke/) was my 300th blog post. Started in 2012 with a self-hosted Wordpress to Netlify-hosted Hugo, going through several deep depressions, a handful of jobs, two babies, one miscarriage, one suicide attempt, and one failed marriage, this will forever be the prayer of my heart in my writing:

<pre><b>
Psalm 19:14
  Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart 
  be acceptable in your sight, 
  O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
</b></pre>

**Tempted by the fruit of another** Saved in 2007 and been an lifelong ESV reader ever since. I still have my 2011 ESV Thinline in Oxblood Goatskin as my daily carry. All of the passages that I have memorized such as Romans 8 and John 1-3 are in the ESV.  Read the Bible 12 times in 2019, half those times in the ESV. I am a big fan. But reading the CSB three times this year so far and I gotta say: you wouldn't have to twist my arm to switch.

Check out my friend and pastor, Matt Henslee on the unboxing of the newest CSB Verse by Verse Reference Bible:

**Covenant Eyes is a fine, fine product**. I use it myself. Customer service is second to none. Highest recommendation. Here's the thing: CE is not flawless. Nothing man-made will ever be. However, what if you could just block all porn sites altogether? Would you be interested in blocking the request before it gets into your home? How about for FREE?

**Praying** - The only way my trauma would be worth it if I could gain souls to Christ.
