  <i>Three Persons and one God, I bless and praise thee,
  	for love so unmerited, so unspeakable,
  	so wondrous, so mighty to save the lost
  	and raise them to glory.</i>

**On how often should we pray to our Father**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on the parable of the unjust judge (Lk. 18) and the friend at midnight (Lk. 11), Jesus&#39; main philosophy of prayer was &quot;harass God your Father incessantly until he comes through for you.&quot;</p>&mdash; Derek Rishmawy (@DZRishmawy) <a href="https://twitter.com/DZRishmawy/status/1259671664888999936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**On seeking after God**

> "The conclusion, therefore, is that of Augustine, who said that the heart of man was created for God and that it cannot find rest until it rests in his Father's heart. Hence all men are really seeking after God, as Augustine also declared, but they do not all seek Him in the right way, nor at the right place. They seek Him down below, and He is up above. They seek Him on the earth, and He is in heaven. They seek Him afar, and He is nearby. They seek Him in money, in property, in fame, in power, and in passion; and He is to be found in the high and the holy places, and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit ([Isa 57:15](https://ebible.com/query?utf=8✓&query=Isa 57%3A15&translation=ESV)). But they do seek Him, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him ([Acts 17:27](https://ebible.com/query?utf=8✓&query=Acts 17%3A27&translation=ESV)). They seek Him and at the same time they flee Him. They have no interest in a knowledge of His ways, and yet they cannot do without Him. They feel themselves attracted to God and at the same time repelled by Him."

**On God**

> *God saves sinners.* 
>
> *God* – the Triune Jehovah, Father, Son and Spirit; three Persons working together in sovereign wisdom, power and love to achieve the salvation of a chosen people, the Father electing, the Son fulfilling the Father’s will by redeeming, the Spirit executing the purpose of Father and Son by renewing.
>
> *Saves* – does everything, first to last, that is involved in bringing man from death in sin to life in glory: plans, achieves and communicates redemption, calls and keeps, justifies, sanctifies, glorifies.
>
> *Sinners* – men as God finds them, guilty, vile, helpless, powerless, unable to lift a finger to do God’s will or better their spiritual lot. God saves sinners – and the force of this confession may not be weakened by disrupting the unity of the work of the Trinity, or by dividing the achievement of salvation between God and man and making the decisive part man’s own, or by soft-pedalling the sinner’s inability so as to allow him to share the praise of his salvation with his Saviour. This is the one point of Calvinistic soteriology which the “five points” are concerned to establish and Arminianism in all its forms to deny: namely, that sinners do not save themselves in any sense at all, but that salvation, first and last, whole and entire, past, present and future, is of the Lord, to whom be glory for ever; amen."
