> People are starving for the greatness of God.

The majesty of God is an unknown cure. There are far more popular prescriptions on the market, but the benefit of any other remedy is brief and shallow. Preaching that does not have the aroma of God&#8217;s greatness may entertain for a season, but it will not touch the hidden cry of the soul: &#8220;Show me thy glory!&#8221;
