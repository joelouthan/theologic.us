<pre><blockquote>
  ... that it is my duty, 
  out of a sense of emptiness,
      to go to Christ, possess, 
        enjoy his fullness as mine,
      as if I had it in myself, 
        because it is
        for me in him;
    that when I do this 
      I am full of the Spirit,
      as a fish that has got 
        from the shore to the sea
      and has all fullness of waters 
        to move in,
      for when faith fills me, 
        then I am full;
    that this is the way to be 
      filled with the Spirit,
      like Stephen, 
        first faith, then fullness,
      for this way makes me most empty,
        and so most fit for the Spirit to fill.
</blockquote></pre>
