Jesus sent Paul on an impossible mission. He said to Paul, &#8216;I am sending you to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins&#8217; (Acts 26:17-18). This is what happens when strongholds are destroyed, and arguments against the truth of God are overcome and thoughts are taken captive for Christ.

This is supernatural work. The eyes of the mind and heart do not open automatically. Logic alone cannot bring it about. That&#8217;s why Paul said, &#8216;No one can say &#8216;Jesus is Lord&#8217; _except in the Holy Spirit_&#8216; (1 Cor 12:3). No logical argument for the lordship of Christ will bring about submission, apart from the work of the Holy Spirit. This is also why Jesus responded to Peter&#8217;s recognition of him with the words, &#8216;Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven&#8217; (Matt 16:17).&#8221;
