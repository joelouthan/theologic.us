## The Text

>Daniel 1:17â€“21 (CSB)  
><sup> 17 </sup> God gave these four young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams of every kind. 

><sup> 18 </sup> At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief eunuch presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 

><sup> 19 </sup> The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to attend the king. 

><sup> 20 </sup> In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and mediums in his entire kingdom. 

><sup> 21 </sup> Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
