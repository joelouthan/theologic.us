**1 Chronicles 29:14 “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.**

When I looked up the verse and read it _in context_, I was blown away from David&#8217;s commencement. Since then, I hear this passage being used to explain the economics of God (while precariously dancing close to the edge of the Prosperity _un_Gospel). At first glance, I can see that. But dig deeper and it is far richer that what we give it credit for.

Here is the reason why I love it so:

_This passage reminds me to bless the people when you speak to the people:
  
_ **&#8220;Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said**

_It reminds me of  who God explicitly is_:
  
**“Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.**

_It reminds me of who am I, apart from God:
  
_ **“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.**

_It reminds me of what God has done in us and for us:_
  
**O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness.**

_It reminds me of what my response is now because of God:_
  
**In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.**

_It always reminds of what my desperately prayers for God to keep on doing:_
  
**O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.**
