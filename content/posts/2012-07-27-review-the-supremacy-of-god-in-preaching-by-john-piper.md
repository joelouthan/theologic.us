**For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.** 1 Corinthians 2:2-5

You know something? I don’t have to preach like anybody else I have ever heard.[<img src="https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/supremacy-god-piper.jpg?resize=189%2C300" alt="" title="supremacy-god-piper" width="189" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-84" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/supremacy-god-piper.jpg?resize=189%2C300 189w, https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/supremacy-god-piper.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

I get to make much of God when I proclaim His Word. I get to lift Christ on high and know nothing except him crucified. I get to be totally and utterly dependent on the power of the Holy Spirit.

What a joy it is to preach the passage at hand. What a relief it is that I don’t have to mention the verse once in the sermon, then go on my own diatribe and spit out my own opinions. What heart-filled gladness that I can see the magnificence of God exalted and in falling so short, I would my very best to explain to others what I am seeing.

But oh, how naïve of me: to be called to preach but only preached just a few sermons. Every single little opportunity savored, gracious and humbled to get that one shot to preach the gospel of God—well, that is maybe your one and only shot. You may not be asked back. You might be barred from preaching there ever again. You might not make it back to preach again next Sunday. 

But you get another try at it. God’s grace abounds and you get one more chance to love, serve, and feed His flock. You get to swallow your pride and open your heart and mind and let His Spirit work through you.

_So, what are you going to do with that one shot?_

**I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word;** 2 Timothy 4:1-2a
