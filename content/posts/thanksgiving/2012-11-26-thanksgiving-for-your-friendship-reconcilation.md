_Lord, you are more precious than silver.
  
Lord, you are more costly than gold.
  
Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds, and
  
nothing I desire compares with you._

2 Chronicles 20:7
  
Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?

Ruth 1:16-18
  
But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.” And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.

Psalm 25:11-15
  
For your name’s sake, O Lord,
  
pardon my guilt, for it is great.
  
Who is the man who fears the Lord?
  
Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
  
His soul shall abide in well-being,
  
and his offspring shall inherit the land.
  
The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,
  
and he makes known to them his covenant.
  
My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
  
for he will pluck my feet out of the net.

Isaiah 41:8-10
  
But you, Israel, my servant,
  
Jacob, whom I have chosen,
  
the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
  
you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
  
and called from its farthest corners,
  
saying to you, “You are my servant,
  
I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
  
fear not, for I am with you;
  
be not dismayed, for I am your God;
  
I will strengthen you, I will help you,
  
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

Psalm 94:18-19
  
When I thought, “My foot slips,”
  
your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.
  
When the cares of my heart are many,
  
your consolations cheer my soul.

Song of Solomon 8:6
  
Set me as a seal upon your heart,
  
as a seal upon your arm,
  
for love is strong as death,
  
jealousy is fierce as the grave.
  
Its flashes are flashes of fire,
  
the very flame of the LORD.

John 15:13-17
  
Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another.

Romans 5:6-11
  
For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
  
Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

2 Corinthians 5:16-21
  
From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

James 2:23
  
and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.
