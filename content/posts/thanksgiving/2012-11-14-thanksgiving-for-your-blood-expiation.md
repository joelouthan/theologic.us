Leviticus 6:28
  
And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.

Leviticus 16:21-22
  
And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.

Matthew 27:20-23
  
Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!” And he said, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”

Hebrews 9:22
  
Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.

Jeremiah 31:34
  
And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”

Psalm 103:6-14
  
The Lord works righteousness
  
and justice for all who are oppressed.
  
He made known his ways to Moses,
  
his acts to the people of Israel.
  
The Lord is merciful and gracious,
  
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
  
He will not always chide,
  
nor will he keep his anger forever.
  
He does not deal with us according to our sins,
  
nor repay us according to our iniquities.
  
For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
  
so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
  
as far as the east is from the west,
  
so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
  
As a father shows compassion to his children,
  
so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.
  
For he knows our frame;
  
he remembers that we are dust.

Romans 8:3-4
  
For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

Romans 15:3
  
For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.”

Revelation 5:9-10
  
And they sang a new song, saying,

“Worthy are you to take the scroll
  
and to open its seals,
  
for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God
  
from every tribe and language and people and nation,
  
and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
  
and they shall reign on the earth.”

Revelation 7:9-17
  
After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

“Therefore they are before the throne of God,
  
and serve him day and night in his temple;
  
and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
  
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
  
the sun shall not strike them,
  
nor any scorching heat.
  
For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
  
and he will guide them to springs of living water,
  
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”

1 John 1:9
  
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
