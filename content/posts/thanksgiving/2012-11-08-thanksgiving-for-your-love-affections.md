In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
  
for his steadfast love endures forever!

Matthew 5:45 For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

Titus 3:4-7
  
But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

Hosea 2:16-23
  
“And in that day, declares the Lord, you will call me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer will you call me ‘My Baal.’ For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more. And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety. And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the Lord.

“And in that day I will answer, declares the Lord,
  
I will answer the heavens,
  
and they shall answer the earth,
  
and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil,
  
and they shall answer Jezreel,
  
and I will sow her for myself in the land.
  
And I will have mercy on No Mercy,
  
and I will say to Not My People, ‘You are my people’;
  
and he shall say, ‘You are my God.’”

Out of my distress I called on the Lord;
  
the Lord answered me and set me free.
  
The Lord is on my side; I will not fear.
  
What can man do to me?
  
The Lord is on my side as my helper;
  
I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.

It is better to take refuge in the Lord
  
than to trust in man.
  
It is better to take refuge in the Lord
  
than to trust in princes.

All nations surrounded me;
  
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
  
They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side;
  
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
  
They surrounded me like bees;
  
they went out like a fire among thorns;
  
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
  
I was pushed hard, so that I was falling,
  
but the Lord helped me.

The Lord is my strength and my song;
  
he has become my salvation.
  
Glad songs of salvation
  
are in the tents of the righteous:
  
“The right hand of the Lord does valiantly,
  
the right hand of the Lord exalts,
  
the right hand of the Lord does valiantly!”

I shall not die, but I shall live,
  
and recount the deeds of the Lord.
  
The Lord has disciplined me severely,
  
but he has not given me over to death.

Open to me the gates of righteousness,
  
that I may enter through them
  
and give thanks to the Lord.
  
This is the gate of the Lord;
  
the righteous shall enter through it.
  
I thank you that you have answered me
  
and have become my salvation.
  
The stone that the builders rejected
  
has become the cornerstone.
  
This is the Lord’s doing;
  
it is marvelous in our eyes.
  
This is the day that the Lord has made;
  
let us rejoice and be glad in it.

Save us, we pray, O Lord!
  
O Lord, we pray, give us success!

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
  
We bless you from the house of the Lord.
  
The Lord is God,
  
and he has made his light to shine upon us.
  
Bind the festal sacrifice with cords,
  
up to the horns of the altar!

You are my God, and I will give thanks to you;
  
you are my God; I will extol you.
  
Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
  
for his steadfast love endures forever!

the moon and stars to rule over the night,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;

to him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and brought Israel out from among them,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
with a strong hand and an outstretched arm,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
to him who divided the Red Sea in two,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and made Israel pass through the midst of it,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
to him who led his people through the wilderness,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;

to him who struck down great kings,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and killed mighty kings,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
Sihon, king of the Amorites,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and Og, king of Bashan,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and gave their land as a heritage,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
a heritage to Israel his servant,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever.

It is he who remembered us in our low estate,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever;
  
and rescued us from our foes,

he who gives food to all flesh,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever.

Give thanks to the God of heaven,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever.

Psalm 138:8
  
The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me;
  
your steadfast love, O Lord, endures forever.
  
Do not forsake the work of your hands.
