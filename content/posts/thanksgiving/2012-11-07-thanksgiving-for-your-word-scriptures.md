John 1:1-5; 14-18
  
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.

Genesis 3:15
  
I will put enmity between you and the woman,
  
and between your offspring and her offspring;
  
he shall bruise your head,
  
and you shall bruise his heel.”

Jeremiah 31:33
  
But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

Psalm 33:6-9
  
By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
  
and by the breath of his mouth all their host.
  
He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap;
  
he puts the deeps in storehouses.
  
Let all the earth fear the Lord;
  
let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
  
For he spoke, and it came to be;
  
he commanded, and it stood firm.

Psalm 19:1-14
  
The heavens declare the glory of God,
  
and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
  
Day to day pours out speech,
  
and night to night reveals knowledge.
  
There is no speech, nor are there words,
  
whose voice is not heard.
  
Their voice goes out through all the earth,
  
and their words to the end of the world.
  
In them he has set a tent for the sun,
  
which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,
  
and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.
  
Its rising is from the end of the heavens,
  
and its circuit to the end of them,
  
and there is nothing hidden from its heat.

The law of the Lord is perfect,
  
reviving the soul;
  
the testimony of the Lord is sure,
  
making wise the simple;
  
the precepts of the Lord are right,
  
rejoicing the heart;
  
the commandment of the Lord is pure,
  
enlightening the eyes;
  
the fear of the Lord is clean,
  
enduring forever;
  
the rules of the Lord are true,
  
and righteous altogether.
  
More to be desired are they than gold,
  
even much fine gold;
  
sweeter also than honey
  
and drippings of the honeycomb.
  
Moreover, by them is your servant warned;
  
in keeping them there is great reward.

Who can discern his errors?
  
Declare me innocent from hidden faults.
  
Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;
  
let them not have dominion over me!
  
Then I shall be blameless,
  
and innocent of great transgression.

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
  
be acceptable in your sight,
  
O Lord, my rock and my redeemer. 

Psalm 119:1-176
  
Blessed are those whose way is blameless,
  
who walk in the law of the Lord!
  
Blessed are those who keep his testimonies,
  
who seek him with their whole heart,
  
who also do no wrong,
  
but walk in his ways!
  
You have commanded your precepts
  
to be kept diligently.
  
Oh that my ways may be steadfast
  
in keeping your statutes!
  
Then I shall not be put to shame,
  
having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.
  
I will praise you with an upright heart,
  
when I learn your righteous rules.
  
I will keep your statutes;
  
do not utterly forsake me!

How can a young man keep his way pure?
  
By guarding it according to your word.
  
With my whole heart I seek you;
  
let me not wander from your commandments!
  
I have stored up your word in my heart,
  
that I might not sin against you.
  
Blessed are you, O Lord;
  
teach me your statutes!
  
With my lips I declare
  
all the rules of your mouth.
  
In the way of your testimonies I delight
  
as much as in all riches.
  
I will meditate on your precepts
  
and fix my eyes on your ways.
  
I will delight in your statutes;
  
I will not forget your word.

Deal bountifully with your servant,
  
that I may live and keep your word.
  
Open my eyes, that I may behold
  
wondrous things out of your law.
  
I am a sojourner on the earth;
  
hide not your commandments from me!
  
My soul is consumed with longing
  
for your rules at all times.
  
You rebuke the insolent, accursed ones,
  
who wander from your commandments.
  
Take away from me scorn and contempt,
  
for I have kept your testimonies.
  
Even though princes sit plotting against me,
  
your servant will meditate on your statutes.
  
Your testimonies are my delight;
  
they are my counselors.

My soul clings to the dust;
  
give me life according to your word!
  
When I told of my ways, you answered me;
  
teach me your statutes!
  
Make me understand the way of your precepts,
  
and I will meditate on your wondrous works.
  
My soul melts away for sorrow;
  
strengthen me according to your word!
  
Put false ways far from me
  
and graciously teach me your law!
  
I have chosen the way of faithfulness;
  
I set your rules before me.
  
I cling to your testimonies, O Lord;
  
let me not be put to shame!
  
I will run in the way of your commandments
  
when you enlarge my heart!

Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes;
  
and I will keep it to the end.
  
Give me understanding, that I may keep your law
  
and observe it with my whole heart.
  
Lead me in the path of your commandments,
  
for I delight in it.
  
Incline my heart to your testimonies,
  
and not to selfish gain!
  
Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things;
  
and give me life in your ways.
  
Confirm to your servant your promise,
  
that you may be feared.
  
Turn away the reproach that I dread,
  
for your rules are good.
  
Behold, I long for your precepts;
  
in your righteousness give me life!

Let your steadfast love come to me, O Lord,
  
your salvation according to your promise;
  
then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me,
  
for I trust in your word.
  
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth,
  
for my hope is in your rules.
  
I will keep your law continually,
  
forever and ever,
  
and I shall walk in a wide place,
  
for I have sought your precepts.
  
I will also speak of your testimonies before kings
  
and shall not be put to shame,
  
for I find my delight in your commandments,
  
which I love.
  
I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love,
  
and I will meditate on your statutes.

Remember your word to your servant,
  
in which you have made me hope.
  
This is my comfort in my affliction,
  
that your promise gives me life.
  
The insolent utterly deride me,
  
but I do not turn away from your law.
  
When I think of your rules from of old,
  
I take comfort, O Lord.
  
Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,
  
who forsake your law.
  
Your statutes have been my songs
  
in the house of my sojourning.
  
I remember your name in the night, O Lord,
  
and keep your law.
  
This blessing has fallen to me,
  
that I have kept your precepts.

The Lord is my portion;
  
I promise to keep your words.
  
I entreat your favor with all my heart;
  
be gracious to me according to your promise.
  
When I think on my ways,
  
I turn my feet to your testimonies;
  
I hasten and do not delay
  
to keep your commandments.
  
Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,
  
I do not forget your law.
  
At midnight I rise to praise you,
  
because of your righteous rules.
  
I am a companion of all who fear you,
  
of those who keep your precepts.
  
The earth, O Lord, is full of your steadfast love;
  
teach me your statutes!

You have dealt well with your servant,
  
O Lord, according to your word.
  
Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
  
for I believe in your commandments.
  
Before I was afflicted I went astray,
  
but now I keep your word.
  
You are good and do good;
  
teach me your statutes.
  
The insolent smear me with lies,
  
but with my whole heart I keep your precepts;
  
their heart is unfeeling like fat,
  
but I delight in your law.
  
It is good for me that I was afflicted,
  
that I might learn your statutes.
  
The law of your mouth is better to me
  
than thousands of gold and silver pieces.

Your hands have made and fashioned me;
  
give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.
  
Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice,
  
because I have hoped in your word.
  
I know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous,
  
and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
  
Let your steadfast love comfort me
  
according to your promise to your servant.
  
Let your mercy come to me, that I may live;
  
for your law is my delight.
  
Let the insolent be put to shame,
  
because they have wronged me with falsehood;
  
as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.
  
Let those who fear you turn to me,
  
that they may know your testimonies.
  
May my heart be blameless in your statutes,
  
that I may not be put to shame!

My soul longs for your salvation;
  
I hope in your word.
  
My eyes long for your promise;
  
I ask, “When will you comfort me?”
  
For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,
  
yet I have not forgotten your statutes.
  
How long must your servant endure?
  
When will you judge those who persecute me?
  
The insolent have dug pitfalls for me;
  
they do not live according to your law.
  
All your commandments are sure;
  
they persecute me with falsehood; help me!
  
They have almost made an end of me on earth,
  
but I have not forsaken your precepts.
  
In your steadfast love give me life,
  
that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.

Forever, O Lord, your word
  
is firmly fixed in the heavens.
  
Your faithfulness endures to all generations;
  
you have established the earth, and it stands fast.
  
By your appointment they stand this day,
  
for all things are your servants.
  
If your law had not been my delight,
  
I would have perished in my affliction.
  
I will never forget your precepts,
  
for by them you have given me life.
  
I am yours; save me,
  
for I have sought your precepts.
  
The wicked lie in wait to destroy me,
  
but I consider your testimonies.
  
I have seen a limit to all perfection,
  
but your commandment is exceedingly broad.

Oh how I love your law!
  
It is my meditation all the day.
  
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,
  
for it is ever with me.
  
I have more understanding than all my teachers,
  
for your testimonies are my meditation.
  
I understand more than the aged,
  
for I keep your precepts.
  
I hold back my feet from every evil way,
  
in order to keep your word.
  
I do not turn aside from your rules,
  
for you have taught me.
  
How sweet are your words to my taste,
  
sweeter than honey to my mouth!
  
Through your precepts I get understanding;
  
therefore I hate every false way.

Your word is a lamp to my feet
  
and a light to my path.
  
I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,
  
to keep your righteous rules.
  
I am severely afflicted;
  
give me life, O Lord, according to your word!
  
Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O Lord,
  
and teach me your rules.
  
I hold my life in my hand continually,
  
but I do not forget your law.
  
The wicked have laid a snare for me,
  
but I do not stray from your precepts.
  
Your testimonies are my heritage forever,
  
for they are the joy of my heart.
  
I incline my heart to perform your statutes
  
forever, to the end.

I hate the double-minded,
  
but I love your law.
  
You are my hiding place and my shield;
  
I hope in your word.
  
Depart from me, you evildoers,
  
that I may keep the commandments of my God.
  
Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live,
  
and let me not be put to shame in my hope!
  
Hold me up, that I may be safe
  
and have regard for your statutes continually!
  
You spurn all who go astray from your statutes,
  
for their cunning is in vain.
  
All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross,
  
therefore I love your testimonies.
  
My flesh trembles for fear of you,
  
and I am afraid of your judgments.

I have done what is just and right;
  
do not leave me to my oppressors.
  
Give your servant a pledge of good;
  
let not the insolent oppress me.
  
My eyes long for your salvation
  
and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.
  
Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love,
  
and teach me your statutes.
  
I am your servant; give me understanding,
  
that I may know your testimonies!
  
It is time for the Lord to act,
  
for your law has been broken.
  
Therefore I love your commandments
  
above gold, above fine gold.
  
Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right;
  
I hate every false way.

Your testimonies are wonderful;
  
therefore my soul keeps them.
  
The unfolding of your words gives light;
  
it imparts understanding to the simple.
  
I open my mouth and pant,
  
because I long for your commandments.
  
Turn to me and be gracious to me,
  
as is your way with those who love your name.
  
Keep steady my steps according to your promise,
  
and let no iniquity get dominion over me.
  
Redeem me from man’s oppression,
  
that I may keep your precepts.
  
Make your face shine upon your servant,
  
and teach me your statutes.
  
My eyes shed streams of tears,
  
because people do not keep your law.

Righteous are you, O Lord,
  
and right are your rules.
  
You have appointed your testimonies in righteousness
  
and in all faithfulness.
  
My zeal consumes me,
  
because my foes forget your words.
  
Your promise is well tried,
  
and your servant loves it.
  
I am small and despised,
  
yet I do not forget your precepts.
  
Your righteousness is righteous forever,
  
and your law is true.
  
Trouble and anguish have found me out,
  
but your commandments are my delight.
  
Your testimonies are righteous forever;
  
give me understanding that I may live.

With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O Lord!
  
I will keep your statutes.
  
I call to you; save me,
  
that I may observe your testimonies.
  
I rise before dawn and cry for help;
  
I hope in your words.
  
My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,
  
that I may meditate on your promise.
  
Hear my voice according to your steadfast love;
  
O Lord, according to your justice give me life.
  
They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose;
  
they are far from your law.
  
But you are near, O Lord,
  
and all your commandments are true.
  
Long have I known from your testimonies
  
that you have founded them forever.

Look on my affliction and deliver me,
  
for I do not forget your law.
  
Plead my cause and redeem me;
  
give me life according to your promise!
  
Salvation is far from the wicked,
  
for they do not seek your statutes.
  
Great is your mercy, O Lord;
  
give me life according to your rules.
  
Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,
  
but I do not swerve from your testimonies.
  
I look at the faithless with disgust,
  
because they do not keep your commands.
  
Consider how I love your precepts!
  
Give me life according to your steadfast love.
  
The sum of your word is truth,
  
and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.

Princes persecute me without cause,
  
but my heart stands in awe of your words.
  
I rejoice at your word
  
like one who finds great spoil.
  
I hate and abhor falsehood,
  
but I love your law.
  
Seven times a day I praise you
  
for your righteous rules.
  
Great peace have those who love your law;
  
nothing can make them stumble.
  
I hope for your salvation, O Lord,
  
and I do your commandments.
  
My soul keeps your testimonies;
  
I love them exceedingly.
  
I keep your precepts and testimonies,
  
for all my ways are before you.

Let my cry come before you, O Lord;
  
give me understanding according to your word!
  
Let my plea come before you;
  
deliver me according to your word.
  
My lips will pour forth praise,
  
for you teach me your statutes.
  
My tongue will sing of your word,
  
for all your commandments are right.
  
Let your hand be ready to help me,
  
for I have chosen your precepts.
  
I long for your salvation, O Lord,
  
and your law is my delight.
  
Let my soul live and praise you,
  
and let your rules help me.
  
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant,
  
for I do not forget your commandments. 

2 Timothy 3:16-4:5
  
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

1 Peter 1:22-25
  
Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for

“All flesh is like grass
  
and all its glory like the flower of grass.
  
The grass withers,
  
and the flower falls,
  
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”

And this word is the good news that was preached to you. 

Revelation 19:11-16
  
Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.

Luke 24:44-49 Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”
