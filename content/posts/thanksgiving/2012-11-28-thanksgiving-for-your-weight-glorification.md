Exodus 14:1-4
  
Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp facing it, by the sea. For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, ‘They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’ And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.” And they did so.

Exodus 14:15-18
  
The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward. Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
  
And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”

Exodus 15:1-18
  
Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying,

“I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
  
the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
  
The Lord is my strength and my song,
  
and he has become my salvation;
  
this is my God, and I will praise him,
  
my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
  
The Lord is a man of war;
  
the Lord is his name.

“Pharaoh’s chariots and his host he cast into the sea,
  
and his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea.
  
The floods covered them;
  
they went down into the depths like a stone.
  
Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power,
  
your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.
  
In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries;
  
you send out your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
  
At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up;
  
the floods stood up in a heap;
  
the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
  
The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,
  
I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them.
  
I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.’
  
You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;
  
they sank like lead in the mighty waters.

“Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?
  
Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
  
awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
  
You stretched out your right hand;
  
the earth swallowed them.

“You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed;
  
you have guided them by your strength
  
to your holy abode.
  
The peoples have heard; they tremble;
  
pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
  
Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed;
  
trembling seizes the leaders of Moab;
  
all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
  
Terror and dread fall upon them;
  
because of the greatness of your arm,
  
they are still as a stone,
  
till your people, O Lord, pass by,
  
till the people pass by whom you have purchased.
  
You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain,
  
the place, O Lord, which you have made for your abode,
  
the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
  
The Lord will reign forever and ever.”

Exodus 16:4-10
  
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.” So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, “At evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against the Lord. For what are we, that you grumble against us?” And Moses said, “When the Lord gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him—what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord.”

Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, ‘Come near before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.’” And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.\

Exodus 24:16-18
  
The glory of the LORD dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

Exodus 28:2-5
  
And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty. You shall speak to all the skillful, whom I have filled with a spirit of skill, that they make Aaron’s garments to consecrate him for my priesthood. These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons to serve me as priests. They shall receive gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.

Exodus 28:40-43
  
“For Aaron’s sons you shall make coats and sashes and caps. You shall make them for glory and beauty. And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests. You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh. They shall reach from the hips to the thighs; and they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they go into the tent of meeting or when they come near the altar to minister in the Holy Place, lest they bear guilt and die. This shall be a statute forever for him and for his offspring after him.

Exodus 33:18-23
  
Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The LORD.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.” And the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”

Exodus 40:34-38
  
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.

Leviticus 9:6
  
And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”

Leviticus 9:23-24
  
And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.

Leviticus 10:3
  
Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD has said, ‘Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” And Aaron held his peace.

Numbers 14:10
  
Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.

Numbers 14:21-23
  
But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD, none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice, shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.

Numbers 16:19
  
Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.

Numbers 16:42
  
And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

Numbers 20:6-9
  
Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them, and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.” And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him.

Deuteronomy 5:24
  
And you said, ‘Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live.

Deuteronomy 28:58
  
“If you are not careful to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the LORD your God,

Joshua 7:19
  
Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”

1 Kings 8:10-11
  
And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.

1 Chronicles 16:8-35
  
Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name;
  
make known his deeds among the peoples!
  
Sing to him; sing praises to him;
  
tell of all his wondrous works!
  
Glory in his holy name;
  
let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!
  
Seek the Lord and his strength;
  
seek his presence continually!
  
Remember the wondrous works that he has done,
  
his miracles and the judgments he uttered,
  
O offspring of Israel his servant,
  
sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!

He is the Lord our God;
  
his judgments are in all the earth.
  
Remember his covenant forever,
  
the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
  
the covenant that he made with Abraham,
  
his sworn promise to Isaac,
  
which he confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
  
as an everlasting covenant to Israel,
  
saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
  
as your portion for an inheritance.”

When you were few in number,
  
and of little account, and sojourners in it,
  
wandering from nation to nation,
  
from one kingdom to another people,
  
he allowed no one to oppress them;
  
he rebuked kings on their account,
  
saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
  
do my prophets no harm!”

Sing to the Lord, all the earth!
  
Tell of his salvation from day to day.
  
Declare his glory among the nations,
  
his marvelous works among all the peoples!
  
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,
  
and he is to be held in awe above all gods.
  
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
  
but the Lord made the heavens.
  
Splendor and majesty are before him;
  
strength and joy are in his place.

Ascribe to the Lord, O clans of the peoples,
  
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength!
  
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
  
bring an offering and come before him!
  
Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;
  
tremble before him, all the earth;
  
yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
  
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice,
  
and let them say among the nations, “The Lord reigns!”
  
Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
  
let the field exult, and everything in it!
  
Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy
  
before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
  
Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
  
for his steadfast love endures forever!

Say also:

“Save us, O God of our salvation,
  
and gather and deliver us from among the nations,
  
that we may give thanks to your holy name,
  
and glory in your praise.

1 Chronicles 22:5
  
For David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.

1 Chronicles 29:10-18
  
Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: “Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.

“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. 

O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.

2 Chronicles 5:11-14
  
And when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to their divisions, and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with 120 priests who were trumpeters; and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord), and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the Lord,

“For he is good,
  
for his steadfast love endures forever,”

the house, the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.

2 Chronicles 7:1-3
  
As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD’s house. When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.”

Nehemiah 9:1-38
  
Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the people of Israel were assembled with fasting and in sackcloth, and with earth on their heads. And the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
  
And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day; for another quarter of it they made confession and worshiped the Lord their God. On the stairs of the Levites stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani; and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God. Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.

“You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you. You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. You found his heart faithful before you, and made with him the covenant to give to his offspring the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite. And you have kept your promise, for you are righteous.

“And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea, and performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted arrogantly against our fathers. And you made a name for yourself, as it is to this day. And you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into mighty waters. By a pillar of cloud you led them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night to light for them the way in which they should go. You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right rules and true laws, good statutes and commandments, and you made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them commandments and statutes and a law by Moses your servant. You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and you told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them.

“But they and our fathers acted presumptuously and stiffened their neck and did not obey your commandments. They refused to obey and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them, but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt.
  
But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them. Even when they had made for themselves a golden calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed great blasphemies, you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them in the way did not depart from them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to light for them the way by which they should go. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst. Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.

“And you gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner. So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. You multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, and you brought them into the land that you had told their fathers to enter and possess. So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
  
And they captured fortified cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all good things, cisterns already hewn, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.

“Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies. But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies. And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey.
  
Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.

“Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. Even in their own kingdom, and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress.

“Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.

Psalm 3:3-4
  
But you, O LORD, are a shield about me,
  
my glory, and the lifter of my head.
  
I cried aloud to the LORD,
  
and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah

Psalm 8:1-9
  
O LORD, our Lord,
  
how majestic is your name in all the earth!
  
You have set your glory above the heavens.
  
Out of the mouth of babies and infants,
  
you have established strength because of your foes,
  
to still the enemy and the avenger.

When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
  
the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
  
what is man that you are mindful of him,
  
and the son of man that you care for him?

Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings
  
and crowned him with glory and honor.
  
You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;
  
you have put all things under his feet,
  
all sheep and oxen,
  
and also the beasts of the field,
  
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
  
whatever passes along the paths of the seas.

O LORD, our Lord,
  
how majestic is your name in all the earth!

Psalm 19:1
  
The heavens declare the glory of God,
  
and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.

Psalm 21:5
  
His glory is great through your salvation;
  
splendor and majesty you bestow on him.

Psalm 22:23
  
You who fear the LORD, praise him!
  
All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him,
  
and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!

Psalm 24:1-10
  
The earth is the LORD’s and the fullness thereof,
  
the world and those who dwell therein,
  
for he has founded it upon the seas
  
and established it upon the rivers. 

Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD?
  
And who shall stand in his holy place?
  
He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
  
who does not lift up his soul to what is false
  
and does not swear deceitfully.
  
He will receive blessing from the LORD
  
and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
  
Such is the generation of those who seek him,
  
who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah 

Lift up your heads, O gates!
  
And be lifted up, O ancient doors,
  
that the King of glory may come in.
  
Who is this King of glory?
  
The LORD, strong and mighty,
  
the LORD, mighty in battle!
  
Lift up your heads, O gates!
  
And lift them up, O ancient doors,
  
that the King of glory may come in.
  
Who is this King of glory?
  
The LORD of hosts,
  
he is the King of glory! Selah&#8217;

Psalm 26:8
  
O LORD, I love the habitation of your house
  
and the place where your glory dwells.

Psalm 29:1-11
  
Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,
  
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
  
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
  
worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness.

The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
  
the God of glory thunders,
  
the Lord, over many waters.
  
The voice of the Lord is powerful;
  
the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.

The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
  
the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
  
He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
  
and Sirion like a young wild ox.

The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.
  
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;
  
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth
  
and strips the forests bare,
  
and in his temple all cry, “Glory!”

The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
  
the Lord sits enthroned as king forever.
  
May the Lord give strength to his people!
  
May the Lord bless his people with peace!

Psalm 30:11-12
  
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
  
you have loosed my sackcloth
  
and clothed me with gladness,
  
that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
  
O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

Psalm 37:20
  
But the wicked will perish;
  
the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures;
  
they vanish—like smoke they vanish away.

Psalm 50:12-15
  
“If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
  
for the world and its fullness are mine.
  
Do I eat the flesh of bulls
  
or drink the blood of goats?
  
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
  
and perform your vows to the Most High,
  
and call upon me in the day of trouble;
  
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.”

Psalm 57:1-11
  
Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
  
for in you my soul takes refuge;
  
in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge,
  
till the storms of destruction pass by.
  
I cry out to God Most High,
  
to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
  
He will send from heaven and save me;
  
he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah
  
God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!

My soul is in the midst of lions;
  
I lie down amid fiery beasts—
  
the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
  
whose tongues are sharp swords.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
  
Let your glory be over all the earth!

They set a net for my steps;
  
my soul was bowed down.
  
They dug a pit in my way,
  
but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
  
My heart is steadfast, O God,
  
my heart is steadfast!
  
I will sing and make melody!
  
Awake, my glory!
  
Awake, O harp and lyre!
  
I will awake the dawn!
  
I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
  
I will sing praises to you among the nations.
  
For your steadfast love is great to the heavens,
  
your faithfulness to the clouds.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
  
Let your glory be over all the earth!

Psalm 62:7
  
On God rests my salvation and my glory;
  
my mighty rock, my refuge is God.

Psalm 63:1-4
  
O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
  
my soul thirsts for you;
  
my flesh faints for you,
  
as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
  
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
  
beholding your power and glory.
  
Because your steadfast love is better than life,
  
my lips will praise you.
  
So I will bless you as long as I live;
  
in your name I will lift up my hands.

Psalm 66:1-4
  
Shout for joy to God, all the earth;
  
sing the glory of his name;
  
give to him glorious praise!
  
Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
  
So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.
  
All the earth worships you
  
and sings praises to you;
  
they sing praises to your name.” Selah

Psalm 71:8
  
My mouth is filled with your praise,
  
and with your glory all the day.

Psalm 72:19
  
Blessed be his glorious name forever;
  
may the whole earth be filled with his glory!
  
Amen and Amen!

Psalm 73:21-26
  
When my soul was embittered,
  
when I was pricked in heart,
  
I was brutish and ignorant;
  
I was like a beast toward you.
  
Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
  
you hold my right hand.
  
You guide me with your counsel,
  
and afterward you will receive me to glory.
  
Whom have I in heaven but you?
  
And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
  
My flesh and my heart may fail,
  
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

Psalm 76:4-6
  
Glorious are you, more majestic
  
than the mountains of prey.
  
The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil;
  
they sank into sleep;
  
all the men of war
  
were unable to use their hands.
  
At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
  
both rider and horse lay stunned.

Psalm 78:4
  
We will not hide them from their children,
  
but tell to the coming generation
  
the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might,
  
and the wonders that he has done.

Psalm 78:59-62
  
When God heard, he was full of wrath,
  
and he utterly rejected Israel.
  
He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh,
  
the tent where he dwelt among mankind,
  
and delivered his power to captivity,
  
his glory to the hand of the foe.
  
He gave his people over to the sword
  
and vented his wrath on his heritage.

Psalm 79:9
  
Help us, O God of our salvation,
  
for the glory of your name;
  
deliver us, and atone for our sins,
  
for your name’s sake!

Psalm 85:9-13
  
Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
  
that glory may dwell in our land.

Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
  
righteousness and peace kiss each other.
  
Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
  
and righteousness looks down from the sky.
  
Yes, the LORD will give what is good,
  
and our land will yield its increase.
  
Righteousness will go before him
  
and make his footsteps a way.

Psalm 86:1-17
  
Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me,
  
for I am poor and needy.
  
Preserve my life, for I am godly;
  
save your servant, who trusts in you—you are my God.
  
Be gracious to me, O Lord,
  
for to you do I cry all the day.
  
Gladden the soul of your servant,
  
for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
  
For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
  
abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you.
  
Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer;
  
listen to my plea for grace.
  
In the day of my trouble I call upon you,
  
for you answer me.

There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,
  
nor are there any works like yours.
  
All the nations you have made shall come
  
and worship before you, O Lord,
  
and shall glorify your name.
  
For you are great and do wondrous things;
  
you alone are God.
  
Teach me your way, O Lord,
  
that I may walk in your truth;
  
unite my heart to fear your name.
  
I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,
  
and I will glorify your name forever.
  
For great is your steadfast love toward me;
  
you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.

O God, insolent men have risen up against me;
  
a band of ruthless men seeks my life,
  
and they do not set you before them.
  
But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
  
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
  
Turn to me and be gracious to me;
  
give your strength to your servant,
  
and save the son of your maidservant.
  
Show me a sign of your favor,
  
that those who hate me may see and be put to shame
  
because you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

Psalm 87:3
  
Glorious things of you are spoken,
  
O city of God. Selah

Psalm 89:17-18
  
For you are the glory of their strength;
  
by your favor our horn is exalted.
  
For our shield belongs to the LORD,
  
our king to the Holy One of Israel.

Psalm 96:1-6
  
Oh sing to the Lord a new song;
  
sing to the Lord, all the earth!
  
Sing to the Lord, bless his name;
  
tell of his salvation from day to day.
  
Declare his glory among the nations,
  
his marvelous works among all the peoples!
  
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;
  
he is to be feared above all gods.
  
For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
  
but the Lord made the heavens.
  
Splendor and majesty are before him;
  
strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

Psalm 97:9
  
For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth;
  
you are exalted far above all gods.

Psalm 102:15
  
Nations will fear the name of the LORD,
  
and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.

Psalm 104:31-35
  
May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
  
may the LORD rejoice in his works,
  
who looks on the earth and it trembles,
  
who touches the mountains and they smoke!
  
I will sing to the LORD as long as I live;
  
I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
  
May my meditation be pleasing to him,
  
for I rejoice in the LORD.
  
Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
  
and let the wicked be no more!
  
Bless the LORD, O my soul!
  
Praise the LORD!

Psalm 105:3
  
Glory in his holy name;
  
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!

Psalm 106:4-5
  
Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people;
  
help me when you save them,
  
that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones,
  
that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
  
that I may glory with your inheritance.

Psalm 106:47-48
  
Save us, O LORD our God,
  
and gather us from among the nations,
  
that we may give thanks to your holy name
  
and glory in your praise.

Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
  
from everlasting to everlasting!
  
And let all the people say, “Amen!”
  
Praise the LORD!

Psalm 108:5
  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
  
Let your glory be over all the earth!

Psalm 113:1-9
  
Praise the Lord!
  
Praise, O servants of the Lord,
  
praise the name of the Lord!

Blessed be the name of the Lord
  
from this time forth and forevermore!
  
From the rising of the sun to its setting,
  
the name of the Lord is to be praised!

The Lord is high above all nations,
  
and his glory above the heavens!
  
Who is like the Lord our God,
  
who is seated on high,
  
who looks far down
  
on the heavens and the earth?
  
He raises the poor from the dust
  
and lifts the needy from the ash heap,
  
to make them sit with princes,
  
with the princes of his people.
  
He gives the barren woman a home,
  
making her the joyous mother of children.
  
Praise the Lord!

Psalm 115:1-3
  
Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory,
  
for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!

Why should the nations say,
  
“Where is their God?”
  
Our God is in the heavens;
  
he does all that he pleases.

Psalm 135:13
  
Your name, O Lord, endures forever,
  
your renown,1 O Lord, throughout all ages.

Psalm 138:4-6
  
All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, O Lord,
  
for they have heard the words of your mouth,
  
and they shall sing of the ways of the Lord,
  
for great is the glory of the Lord.
  
For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly,
  
but the haughty he knows from afar.

Psalm 145:5
  
On the glorious splendor of your majesty,
  
and on your wondrous works, I will meditate.

Psalm 145:11-13
  
They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom
  
and tell of your power,
  
to make known to the children of man your mighty deeds,
  
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
  
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
  
and your dominion endures throughout all generations.
  
The LORD is faithful in all his words
  
and kind in all his works.

Psalm 149:5
   
Let the godly exult in glory;
  
let them sing for joy on their beds.

Isaiah 4:2-6
  
In that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel. And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
  
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning. Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy. There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.

Isaiah 6:1-7
  
In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
  
the whole earth is full of his glory!”

And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”

Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

Isaiah 10:16
  
Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts
  
will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors,
  
and under his glory a burning will be kindled,
  
like the burning of fire.

Isaiah 12:5-6
  
“Sing praises to the LORD, for he has done gloriously;
  
let this be made known in all the earth.
  
Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
  
for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”

Isaiah 26:15
  
But you have increased the nation, O LORD,
  
you have increased the nation; you are glorified;
  
you have enlarged all the borders of the land.

Isaiah 28:5-6
  
In that day the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory,
  
and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people,
  
and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
  
and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

Isaiah 40:5
  
And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,
  
and all flesh shall see it together,
  
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”

Isaiah 40:9-31
       
Go on up to a high mountain,
            
O Zion, herald of good news;
       
lift up your voice with strength,
            
O Jerusalem, herald of good news;
            
lift it up, fear not;
       
say to the cities of Judah,
            
“Behold your God!”
       
Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might,
            
and his arm rules for him;
       
behold, his reward is with him,
            
and his recompense before him.
       
He will tend his flock like a shepherd;
            
he will gather the lambs in his arms;
       
he will carry them in his bosom,
            
and gently lead those that are with young.
       
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
            
and marked off the heavens with a span,
       
enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure
            
and weighed the mountains in scales
            
and the hills in a balance?
       
Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD,
            
or what man shows him his counsel?
       
Whom did he consult,
            
and who made him understand?
       
Who taught him the path of justice,
            
and taught him knowledge,
            
and showed him the way of understanding?
       
Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,
            
and are accounted as the dust on the scales;
            
behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust.
       
Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,
            
nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
       
All the nations are as nothing before him,
            
they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
       
To whom then will you liken God,
            
or what likeness compare with him?
       
An idol! A craftsman casts it,
            
and a goldsmith overlays it with gold
            
and casts for it silver chains.
       
He who is too impoverished for an offering
            
chooses wood that will not rot;
       
he seeks out a skillful craftsman
            
to set up an idol that will not move.
       
Do you not know? Do you not hear?
            
Has it not been told you from the beginning?
            
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
       
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
            
and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
       
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
            
and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;
       
who brings princes to nothing,
            
and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.
       
Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,
            
scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,
       
when he blows on them, and they wither,
            
and the tempest carries them off like stubble.
       
To whom then will you compare me,
            
that I should be like him? says the Holy One.
       
Lift up your eyes on high and see:
            
who created these?
       
He who brings out their host by number,
            
calling them all by name,
       
by the greatness of his might,
            
and because he is strong in power
            
not one is missing.
       
Why do you say, O Jacob,
            
and speak, O Israel,
       
“My way is hidden from the LORD,
            
and my right is disregarded by my God”?
       
Have you not known? Have you not heard?
       
The LORD is the everlasting God,
            
the Creator of the ends of the earth.
       
He does not faint or grow weary;
            
his understanding is unsearchable.
       
He gives power to the faint,
            
and to him who has no might he increases strength.
       
Even youths shall faint and be weary,
            
and young men shall fall exhausted;
       
but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength;
            
they shall mount up with wings like eagles;
       
they shall run and not be weary;
            
they shall walk and not faint.

Isaiah 41:14-16
  
Fear not, you worm Jacob,
  
you men of Israel!
  
I am the one who helps you, declares the Lord;
  
your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
  
Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge,
  
new, sharp, and having teeth;
  
you shall thresh the mountains and crush them,
  
and you shall make the hills like chaff;
  
you shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away,
  
and the tempest shall scatter them.
  
And you shall rejoice in the Lord;
  
in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.

Isaiah 42:1-25
  
Behold my servant, whom I uphold,
  
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
  
I have put my Spirit upon him;
  
he will bring forth justice to the nations.
  
He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,
  
or make it heard in the street;
  
a bruised reed he will not break,
  
and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;
  
he will faithfully bring forth justice.
  
He will not grow faint or be discouraged
  
till he has established justice in the earth;
  
and the coastlands wait for his law.

Thus says God, the Lord,
  
who created the heavens and stretched them out,
  
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
  
who gives breath to the people on it
  
and spirit to those who walk in it:
  
“I am the Lord; I have called you in righteousness;
  
I will take you by the hand and keep you;
  
I will give you as a covenant for the people,
  
a light for the nations,
  
to open the eyes that are blind,
  
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
  
from the prison those who sit in darkness.
  
I am the Lord; that is my name;
  
my glory I give to no other,
  
nor my praise to carved idols.
  
Behold, the former things have come to pass,
  
and new things I now declare;
  
before they spring forth
  
I tell you of them.”

Sing to the Lord a new song,
  
his praise from the end of the earth,
  
you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it,
  
the coastlands and their inhabitants.
  
Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice,
  
the villages that Kedar inhabits;
  
let the habitants of Sela sing for joy,
  
let them shout from the top of the mountains.
  
Let them give glory to the Lord,
  
and declare his praise in the coastlands.
  
The Lord goes out like a mighty man,
  
like a man of war he stirs up his zeal;
  
he cries out, he shouts aloud,
  
he shows himself mighty against his foes.

For a long time I have held my peace;
  
I have kept still and restrained myself;
  
now I will cry out like a woman in labor;
  
I will gasp and pant.
  
I will lay waste mountains and hills,
  
and dry up all their vegetation;
  
I will turn the rivers into islands,
  
and dry up the pools.
  
And I will lead the blind
  
in a way that they do not know,
  
in paths that they have not known
  
I will guide them.
  
I will turn the darkness before them into light,
  
the rough places into level ground.
  
These are the things I do,
  
and I do not forsake them.
  
They are turned back and utterly put to shame,
  
who trust in carved idols,
  
who say to metal images,
  
“You are our gods.”

Hear, you deaf,
  
and look, you blind, that you may see!
  
Who is blind but my servant,
  
or deaf as my messenger whom I send?
  
Who is blind as my dedicated one,
  
or blind as the servant of the Lord?
  
He sees many things, but does not observe them;
  
his ears are open, but he does not hear.
  
The Lord was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake,
  
to magnify his law and make it glorious.
  
But this is a people plundered and looted;
  
they are all of them trapped in holes
  
and hidden in prisons;
  
they have become plunder with none to rescue,
  
spoil with none to say, “Restore!”
  
Who among you will give ear to this,
  
will attend and listen for the time to come?
  
Who gave up Jacob to the looter,
  
and Israel to the plunderers?
  
Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned,
  
in whose ways they would not walk,
  
and whose law they would not obey?
  
So he poured on him the heat of his anger
  
and the might of battle;
  
it set him on fire all around, but he did not understand;
  
it burned him up, but he did not take it to heart.

Isaiah 43:1-7
  
But now thus says the Lord,
  
he who created you, O Jacob,
  
he who formed you, O Israel:
  
“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
  
I have called you by name, you are mine.
  
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
  
and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
  
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
  
and the flame shall not consume you.
  
For I am the Lord your God,
  
the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
  
I give Egypt as your ransom,
  
Cush and Seba in exchange for you.
  
Because you are precious in my eyes,
  
and honored, and I love you,
  
I give men in return for you,
  
peoples in exchange for your life.
  
Fear not, for I am with you;
  
I will bring your offspring from the east,
  
and from the west I will gather you.
  
I will say to the north, Give up,
  
and to the south, Do not withhold;
  
bring my sons from afar
  
and my daughters from the end of the earth,
  
everyone who is called by my name,
  
whom I created for my glory,
  
whom I formed and made.”

Isaiah 44:23
  
Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it;
  
shout, O depths of the earth;
  
break forth into singing, O mountains,
  
O forest, and every tree in it!
  
For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,
  
and will be glorified in Israel.

Isaiah 45:25
  
In the LORD all the offspring of Israel
  
shall be justified and shall glory.”

Isaiah 46:13
  
I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off,
  
and my salvation will not delay;
  
I will put salvation in Zion,
  
for Israel my glory.”

Isaiah 48:1-25
  
Hear this, O house of Jacob,
  
who are called by the name of Israel,
  
and who came from the waters of Judah,
  
who swear by the name of the Lord
  
and confess the God of Israel,
  
but not in truth or right.
  
For they call themselves after the holy city,
  
and stay themselves on the God of Israel;
  
the Lord of hosts is his name.

“The former things I declared of old;
  
they went out from my mouth, and I announced them;
  
then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
  
Because I know that you are obstinate,
  
and your neck is an iron sinew
  
and your forehead brass,
  
I declared them to you from of old,
  
before they came to pass I announced them to you,
  
lest you should say, ‘My idol did them,
  
my carved image and my metal image commanded them.’

“You have heard; now see all this;
  
and will you not declare it?
  
From this time forth I announce to you new things,
  
hidden things that you have not known.
  
They are created now, not long ago;
  
before today you have never heard of them,
  
lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
  
You have never heard, you have never known,
  
from of old your ear has not been opened.
  
For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously,
  
and that from before birth you were called a rebel.

“For my name’s sake I defer my anger,
  
for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you,
  
that I may not cut you off.
  
Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver;
  
I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
  
For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,
  
for how should my name be profaned?
  
My glory I will not give to another.

“Listen to me, O Jacob,
  
and Israel, whom I called!
  
I am he; I am the first,
  
and I am the last.
  
My hand laid the foundation of the earth,
  
and my right hand spread out the heavens;
  
when I call to them,
  
they stand forth together.

“Assemble, all of you, and listen!
  
Who among them has declared these things?
  
The Lord loves him;
  
he shall perform his purpose on Babylon,
  
and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
  
I, even I, have spoken and called him;
  
I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
  
Draw near to me, hear this:
  
from the beginning I have not spoken in secret,
  
from the time it came to be I have been there.”
  
And now the Lord God has sent me, and his Spirit.

Thus says the Lord,
  
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
  
“I am the Lord your God,
  
who teaches you to profit,
  
who leads you in the way you should go.
  
Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments!
  
Then your peace would have been like a river,
  
and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
  
your offspring would have been like the sand,
  
and your descendants like its grains;
  
their name would never be cut off
  
or destroyed from before me.”

Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea,
  
declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it,
  
send it out to the end of the earth;
  
say, “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob!”
  
They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;
  
he made water flow for them from the rock;
  
he split the rock and the water gushed out.

“There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”

Isaiah 49:3
  
And he said to me, “You are my servant,
  
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”

Isaiah 55:5
  
Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,
  
and a nation that did not know you shall run to you,
  
because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel,
  
for he has glorified you.

Isaiah 58:8
  
Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,
  
and your healing shall spring up speedily;
  
your righteousness shall go before you;
  
the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.

Isaiah 59:19
  
So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west,
  
and his glory from the rising of the sun;
  
for he will come like a rushing stream,
  
which the wind of the LORD drives.

Isaiah 60:1-3
  
Arise, shine, for your light has come,
  
and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
  
For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
  
and thick darkness the peoples;
  
but the LORD will arise upon you,
  
and his glory will be seen upon you.
  
And nations shall come to your light,
  
and kings to the brightness of your rising.

Isaiah 60:19-22
  
The sun shall be no more
  
your light by day,
  
nor for brightness shall the moon
  
give you light;
  
but the LORD will be your everlasting light,
  
and your God will be your glory.
  
Your sun shall no more go down,
  
nor your moon withdraw itself;
  
for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
  
and your days of mourning shall be ended.
  
Your people shall all be righteous;
  
they shall possess the land forever,
  
the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,
  
that I might be glorified.
  
The least one shall become a clan,
  
and the smallest one a mighty nation;
  
I am the LORD;
  
in its time I will hasten it.

Isaiah 61:1-4
  
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
  
because the LORD has anointed me
  
to bring good news to the poor;
  
he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
  
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
  
and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
  
to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,
  
and the day of vengeance of our God;
  
to comfort all who mourn;
  
to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
  
to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
  
the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
  
the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
  
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
  
the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
  
They shall build up the ancient ruins;
  
they shall raise up the former devastations;
  
they shall repair the ruined cities,
  
the devastations of many generations.

Isaiah 62:2
  
The nations shall see your righteousness,
  
and all the kings your glory,
  
and you shall be called by a new name
  
that the mouth of the LORD will give.

Isaiah 63:11-14
  
Then he remembered the days of old,
  
of Moses and his people.
  
Where is he who brought them up out of the sea
  
with the shepherds of his flock?
  
Where is he who put in the midst of them
  
his Holy Spirit,
  
who caused his glorious arm
  
to go at the right hand of Moses,
  
who divided the waters before them
  
to make for himself an everlasting name,
  
who led them through the depths?
  
Like a horse in the desert,
  
they did not stumble.
  
Like livestock that go down into the valley,
  
the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest.
  
So you led your people,
  
to make for yourself a glorious name.

Isaiah 66:5
  
Hear the word of the LORD,
  
you who tremble at his word:
  
“Your brothers who hate you
  
and cast you out for my name’s sake
  
have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified,
  
that we may see your joy’;
  
but it is they who shall be put to shame.

Isaiah 66:12
  
For thus says the LORD:
  
“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
  
and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;
  
and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip,
  
and bounced upon her knees.

Isaiah 66:18-24
  
“For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory, and I will set a sign among them.
  
And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations. And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD. And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.

“For as the new heavens and the new earth
  
that I make
  
shall remain before me, says the LORD,
  
so shall your offspring and your name remain.
  
From new moon to new moon,
  
and from Sabbath to Sabbath,
  
all flesh shall come to worship before me,
  
declares the LORD.

“And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”

Jeremiah 4:1-2
  
“If you return, O Israel,
  
declares the LORD,
  
to me you should return.
  
If you remove your detestable things from my presence,
  
and do not waver,
  
and if you swear, ‘As the LORD lives,’
  
in truth, in justice, and in righteousness,
  
then nations shall bless themselves in him,
  
and in him shall they glory.”

Jeremiah 13:16-17
  
Give glory to the LORD your God
  
before he brings darkness,
  
before your feet stumble
  
on the twilight mountains,
  
and while you look for light
  
he turns it into gloom
  
and makes it deep darkness.
  
But if you will not listen,
  
my soul will weep in secret for your pride;
  
my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears,
  
because the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.

Jeremiah 14:21-22
  
Do not spurn us, for your name’s sake;
  
do not dishonor your glorious throne;
  
remember and do not break your covenant with us.
  
Are there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain?
  
Or can the heavens give showers?
  
Are you not he, O LORD our God?
  
We set our hope on you,
  
for you do all these things.

Jeremiah 17:12-13
  
A glorious throne set on high from the beginning
  
is the place of our sanctuary.
  
O LORD, the hope of Israel,
  
all who forsake you shall be put to shame;
  
those who turn away from you shall be written in the earth,
  
for they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.

Jeremiah 33:2-9
  
“Thus says the Lord who made the earth, the Lord who formed it to establish it—the Lord is his name: Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known. For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and against the sword:
  
They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil. Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security. I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first. I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me. And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.

Ezekiel 1:28
  
Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.

Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

Ezekiel 3:12-15
  
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!”
  
It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake. The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me. And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.

Ezekiel 3:23
  
So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the Chebar canal, and I fell on my face.

Ezekiel 8:4
  
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.

Ezekiel 9:3
  
Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.

Ezekiel 10:4
  
And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.

Ezekiel 10:18-19
  
Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.

Ezekiel 11:14-25
  
And the word of the Lord came to me: “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far from the Lord; to us this land is given for a possession.’ Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.’
  
Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’ And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations. And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord God.”

Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. And I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me.

Ezekiel 28:20-24
  
The word of the Lord came to me: “Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her and say, Thus says the Lord God:

“Behold, I am against you, O Sidon,
  
and I will manifest my glory in your midst.
  
And they shall know that I am the Lord
  
when I execute judgments in her
  
and manifest my holiness in her;
  
for I will send pestilence into her,
  
and blood into her streets;
  
and the slain shall fall in her midst,
  
by the sword that is against her on every side.
  
Then they will know that I am the Lord.

“And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.

Ezekiel 39:13
  
All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that I show my glory, declares the Lord GOD.

Ezekiel 39:21-22
  
“And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them. The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.

Ezekiel 43:2
  
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.

Ezekiel 43:1-5
  
Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory. And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face. As the glory of the Lord entered the temple by the gate facing east, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

Ezekiel 44:4
  
Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD. And I fell on my face.

Daniel 7:9-14
  
“As I looked,
  
thrones were placed,
  
and the Ancient of Days took his seat;
  
his clothing was white as snow,
  
and the hair of his head like pure wool;
  
his throne was fiery flames;
  
its wheels were burning fire.
  
A stream of fire issued
  
and came out from before him;
  
a thousand thousands served him,
  
and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;
  
the court sat in judgment,
  
and the books were opened.

“I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

“I saw in the night visions,

and behold, with the clouds of heaven
  
there came one like a son of man,
  
and he came to the Ancient of Days
  
and was presented before him.
  
And to him was given dominion
  
and glory and a kingdom,
  
that all peoples, nations, and languages
  
should serve him;
  
his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
  
which shall not pass away,
  
and his kingdom one
  
that shall not be destroyed.

Habakkuk 2:14
  
For the earth will be filled
  
with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD
  
as the waters cover the sea.

Haggai 1:8
  
Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD.

Haggai 2:7-9
  
And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD of hosts. The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the LORD of hosts.’”

Zechariah 2:1-13
  
And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand! Then I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”
  
And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him and said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the Lord, and I will be the glory in her midst.’”

Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the Lord. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the Lord. Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. For thus said the Lord of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye: “Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the Lord. And many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. And the Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.”

Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.

Zephaniah 3:17
  
The LORD your God is in your midst,
  
a mighty one who will save;
  
he will rejoice over you with gladness;
  
he will quiet you by his love;
  
he will exult over you with loud singing.

Matthew 16:27
  
For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done.

Matthew 19:28
  
Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Matthew 24:30-31
  
Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

Matthew 25:31-46
  
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’
  
“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’
  
Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

Mark 13:26-27
  
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.

Luke 2:8-21
  
And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

“Glory to God in the highest,
  
and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”

When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

Luke 4:15
  
And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

Luke 5:25-26
  
And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”

Luke 7:16
  
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and “God has visited his people!”

Luke 9:26-27
  
For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”

Luke 9:32-36
  
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. As he was saying
   
these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!” And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.

Luke 13:13
  
And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God.

Luke 13:17
  
As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.

Luke 21:7-28
  
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

Luke 24:26
  
Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”

John 1:1-18
  
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)
  
And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.

John 7:18
  
The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.

John 8:48-59
  
The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.” The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.’ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?” Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do
  
know him and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.” So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

John 9:24-25
  
So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” He answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”

John 11:40-43
  
Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.” When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.”

John 12:16
   
His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.

John 12:23
  
And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

John 12:27-36
  
“Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the
  
darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.”

When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.

John 12:41
  
Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him.

John 13:31-35
  
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

John 14:13-14
  
Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

John 15:8-17
  
By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.
  
“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another.

John 16:14-15
  
He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

John 17:1-26
  
When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

“I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them,
   
and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.

“I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and
  
these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”

John 21:15-19
  
When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.” (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, “Follow me.”

Acts 7:1-60
  
And the high priest said, “Are these things so?” And Stephen said:

“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.’ Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. ‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

“And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out
   
our fathers on their first visit. And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh. And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.

“But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God’s sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father’s house, and when he was exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.

“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not
   
understand. And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?’ But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.

“Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord: ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.’

“This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’—this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red
  
Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.’ This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, saying to Aaron, ‘Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:

“‘Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices,
  
during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
  
You took up the tent of Moloch
  
and the star of your god Rephan,
  
the images that you made to worship;
  
and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.’

“Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen. Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our
   
fathers. So it was until the days of David, who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. But it was Solomon who built a house for him. Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,

“‘Heaven is my throne,
  
and the earth is my footstool.
  
What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord,
  
or what is the place of my rest?
  
Did not my hand make all these things?’

“You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.”

Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him. But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and
   
rushed together at him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their
  
garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Acts 13:48
  
And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.

Romans 5:2
  
Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

Romans 6:4
  
We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

Romans 11:36
  
For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.

Romans 15:1-7
  
We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.” For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.

Romans 16:25-27
  
Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith— to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.

1 Corinthians 2:7-8
  
But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None
   
of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

1 Corinthians 11:7
   
For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.

2 Corinthians 1:20
  
For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.

2 Corinthians 3:10-11
  
Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.

2 Corinthians 4:4-6
  
In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

2 Corinthians 4:15-18
  
For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God. So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

Galatians 1:3-5
  
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

Ephesians 1:3-14
  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise
  
of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.

Philippians 2:9-11
  
Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

Philippians 4:19-20
  
And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.

Colossians 1:11-13
  
May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,

Colossians 1:27
  
To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

Colossians 3:4
  
When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

1 Thessalonians 2:10-12
  
You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. For you know how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.

2 Thessalonians 2:14
  
To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1 Timothy 1:8-17
  
Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.

I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that
  
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

1 Timothy 3:16
  
Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness:
  
He was manifested in the flesh,
  
vindicated by the Spirit,
  
seen by angels,
  
proclaimed among the nations,
  
believed on in the world,
  
taken up in glory.

2 Timothy 2:10
  
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

2 Timothy 4:18
  
The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

Titus 2:11-14
  
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

Hebrews 1:3-4
  
He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

Hebrews 2:7-9
  
You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
  
you have crowned him with glory and honor,
  
putting everything in subjection under his feet.”

Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see him who
   
for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

Hebrews 3:1-3
  
Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house. For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than 

Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.

Hebrews 13:20-21
  
Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

James 2:1
  
My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.

1 Peter 1:6-7
  
In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so
  
that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

1 Peter 1:20-21
  
He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.

1 Peter 4:10-11
  
As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

1 Peter 5:1
  
So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:

1 Peter 5:10-11
  
And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
  
will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

2 Peter 1:3-11
  
His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

2 Peter 1:17-18
  
For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain.

2 Peter 3:18
  
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

Jude 1:24-25
  
Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

Revelation 1:4-8
  
John to the seven churches that are in Asia:
  
Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.
  
To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.

“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

Revelation 4:9-11
  
And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

“Worthy are you, our Lord and God,
  
to receive glory and honor and power,
  
for you created all things,
  
and by your will they existed and were created.”

Revelation 5:11-14
  
Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels,
  
numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!” And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.

Revelation 7:9-12
  
After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

Revelation 14:7
  
And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.”

Revelation 15:1-4
  
Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
  
And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,

“Great and amazing are your deeds,
  
O Lord God the Almighty!
  
Just and true are your ways,
  
O King of the nations!
  
Who will not fear, O Lord,
  
and glorify your name?
  
For you alone are holy.
  
All nations will come
  
and worship you,
  
for your righteous acts have been revealed.”

Revelation 15:7-8
  
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever, and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.

Revelation 19:1-22:21
  
After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out,

“Hallelujah!
  
Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
  
for his judgments are true and just;
  
for he has judged the great prostitute
  
who corrupted the earth with her immorality,
  
and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”

Once more they cried out,

“Hallelujah!
  
The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.”

And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” And from the throne came a voice saying,

“Praise our God,
  
all you his servants,
  
you who fear him,
  
small and great.”

Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out,

“Hallelujah!
  
For the Lord our God
  
the Almighty reigns.
  
Let us rejoice and exult
  
and give him the glory,
  
for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
  
and his Bride has made herself ready;
  
it was granted her to clothe herself
  
with fine linen, bright and pure”—

for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.

And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.

Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were
   
thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.

Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.

Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.

And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be
   
released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
   
coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”

And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.” And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
   
having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed— on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls. The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel’s measurement. The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.

And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the
  
Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.

And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.”

“And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”

I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”

And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”

“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”

Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”

The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.

I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.

Psalm 17:15
  
As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
  
when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.

Romans 8:1-39
  
There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.

So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.

For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,

“For your sake we are being killed all the day long;
  
we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”

No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
