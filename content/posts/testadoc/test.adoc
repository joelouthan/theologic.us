:description: A demo of Asciidoctor. This document +
              exercises numerous features of AsciiDoc +
              to test Asciidoctor compliance.
:library: Asciidoctor

[role='lead']
This is a demonstration of {library}. And this is the preamble of this document.

[[purpose]]
.Purpose
****
This document exercises many of the features of AsciiDoc to test the {library} implementation.
****

TIP: If you want the output to look familiar, copy (or link) the AsciiDoc stylesheet, asciidoc.css, to the output directory.

NOTE: Items marked with TODO are either not yet supported or a work in progress.



[[first,First Steps]]
== First Steps with http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc]

.Inline markup
* single quotes around a phrase place 'emphasis'
* astericks around a phrase make the text *bold*
* double astericks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasize that substring
* use carrots around characters to make them ^super^script
* use tildes around characters to make them ~sub~script
ifdef::basebackend-html[]
* to pass through +++<u>HTML</u>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus
endif::basebackend-html[]
ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
* to pass through +++<constant>XML</constant>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- characters can be escaped using a {backslash}
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like 'Here\'s Johnny!'
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when rendering
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp} attribute
- hold text together with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}
- handle words with unicode characters like in the name Gregory Romé
- claim your copyright (C), registered trademark (R) or trademark (TM)

You can write text http://example.com[with inline links], optionally{sp}using an explicit link:http://example.com[link prefix]. In either case, the link can have a http://example.com?foo=bar&lang=en[query string].

If you want to break a line +
just end it in a {plus} sign +
and continue typing on the next line.

=== Lists Upon Lists

.Adjacent lists
* this list
* should join

* to have
* four items

[[numbered]]
.Numbered lists
. These items
. will be auto-numbered
.. and can be nested
. A numbered list can nest
* unordered
* list
* items

.Statement
I swear I left it in 'Guy\'s' car. Let\'s go look for it.

[[defs]]
term::
  definition
line two
[[another_term]]another term::

  another definition, which can be literal (indented) or regular paragraph

This should be a standalone paragraph, not grabbed by the definition list.

[[nested]]
* first level
written on two lines
* first level
+
....
with this literal text
....
+
** second level
*** third level
- fourth level
* back to +
first level

// this is just a comment

Let's make a horizontal rule...

'''

then take a break.

We'll be right with you...

after this brief interruption.

[source, ruby]
----
doc = Asciidoctor::Document.new("*This* is it!", :header_footer => false)

puts doc.render

// FIXME: use ifdef to show output according to backend
Here's what it outputs (using the built-in templates):

....
<div class="paragraph">

=== ``Quotes''

____
AsciiDoc is 'so' *powerful*!
____

This verse comes to mind.

[verse]
I am desired to preach today,
      but go weak and needy to my task;
Yet I long that people might be edified
    with divine truth,
  that an honest testimony might be borne
    for thee;
Give me assistance in preaching and prayer,
  with heart uplifted for grace and unction.
Present to my view things pertinent to
    my subject,
  with fullness of matter and clarity of thought,
  proper expressions, fluency, fervency,
  a feeling sense of the things I preach,
  and grace to apply them to men’s consciences.
Keep me conscious all the while of my defects,
  and let me not gloat in pride over
    my performance.
Help me to offer a testimony for thyself,
  and to leave sinners inexcusable in neglecting
    thy mercy.
Give me freedom to open the sorrows of thy people,
  and to set before them comforting considerations.
Attend with power the truth preached,
  and awaken the attention of my slothful audience.
May thy people be refreshed, melted, convicted,
    comforted,
  and help me to use the strongest arguments
    drawn from Christ’s incarnation and sufferings,
    that men might be made holy.

I myself need thy support, comfort, strength,
    holiness,
  that I might be a pure channel of thy grace,
  and be able to do something for thee;
Give me then refreshment among thy people,
  and help me not to treat excellent matter
    in a defective way,
  or bear a broken testimony to so worthy
    a Redeemer,
  or be harsh in treating of Christ’s death,
    its design and end,
  from lack of warmth and fervency.
And keep me in tune with thee
    as I do this work.

Here's another quote:

[quote, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]
____
When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

Getting Literal [[literally]]
-----------------------------

 Want to get literal? Just prefix a line with a space (just one will do).

....
I'll join that party, too.
....

We forgot to mention in <<numbered>> that you can change the numbering style.

.. first item (yeah!)
.. second item, looking `so mono`
.. third item, +mono+ it is!

// This attribute line will get reattached to the next block
// despite being followed by a trailing blank line
[id='wrapup']

== Wrap-up

NOTE: AsciiDoc is quite cool, you should try it!
