## The Title

Book: **Book First: Of the Knowledge of God the Creator**
Chapter: **The Knowledge of God Stiffed or Corrupted, Ignorantly or Maliciously**

## The Sections

1. The knowledge of God suppressed by ignorance, many falling away into superstition. Such persons, however, inexcusable, because their error is accompanied pride and stubbornness.
2. Stubbornness the companion of impiety.
3. No pretext can justify superstition. This proved, first, from reason; and, second, from Scripture.
4. The wicked never willingly come into the presence of God. Hence their hypocrisy.Hence, too, their sense of deity leads to no good result.
