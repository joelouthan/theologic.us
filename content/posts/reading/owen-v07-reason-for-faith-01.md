## The Title

**The Complete Works of John Owen**  
Volume: **VII The Holy Spirit--The Helper**  
Book: **The Reason for Faith**  
Chapter: **The Subject Stated**

## The Inquiries

THE PRINCIPAL DESIGN of that discourse whereof the ensuing treatise is a part, is to declare the work of the Holy Ghost in the illumination of the minds of men. For this work is particularly and eminently ascribed unto him, or the efficacy of the grace of God by him dispensed (Eph. 1:17-18; Heb. 6:4; Luke 2:32; Acts 13:47; 16:14; 26:18; 2 Cor. 4:4; 1 Pet. 2:9). The objective cause and outward means of it are the subjects at present designed unto consideration; and it will issue in these two inquiries.

1. On what grounds, or for what reason, we do believe the Scripture to be the word of God with faith divine and supernatural, as it is required of us in a way of duty?
2. How or by what means we may come to understand aright the mind of God in the Scripture, or the revelations that are made unto us of his mind and will therein?

## The Text

>Ephesians 1:17–18 (CSB) I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints,

>Hebrews 6:4 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit,

>Luke 2:32 (CSB) a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to your people Israel.

>Acts 13:47 (CSB) For this is what the Lord has commanded us: I have made you a light for the Gentiles to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.”

>Acts 16:14 (CSB) A God-fearing woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying.

>Acts 26:18 (CSB) to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’

>2 Corinthians 4:4 (CSB) In their case, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

>1 Peter 2:9 (CSB) But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
