<pre>We will worship the Lamb of glory,
We will worship the King of kings.
We will worship the Lamb of glory,
We will worship the King.

We bless the name of the Lamb of Glory.
We bless the name of the King of Kings.
We bless the name of the Lamb of Glory.
We bless the name of the King.

We give all praise to the Lamb of Glory.
We give all praise to the King of Kings.
We give all praise to the Lamb of Glory.
We give all praise to the King.

<em>And with our hands lifted high,
we will worship and sing.
And with our hands lifted high,
we come before You rejoicing.

With our hands lifted high to the sky,
when the world wonders why.
We'll just tell them we're loving our King.

We'll just tell them we're loving our King.</em></pre>
