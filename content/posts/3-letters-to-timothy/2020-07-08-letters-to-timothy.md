**1 Timothy 1:1-2 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,**

**To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.**

## God the Father

I was molested and abused by my dad from when I was 7 to about 11 years old. In the middle of that abuse and neglect with a mom who abandoned me at five, a stepmom who also abused and neglected me and a grandma who looked the other way and would believe her son over her grandson, I heard the gospel of God.

I know that I know I did not believe and trusted right away. I tried. But the comforts of porn and lust were too much for me to let go. I never repented and was only sorry when I caught with porn.  When I moved out of my grandma's house to join the military, I could bathe in the sin of pornography and lust to my heart's content. About the same time, the internet was becoming a household item. My entire goal in life was to get faster and faster internet connection with faster computers that could hold more and more data so I could feed on more porn.  So much so, my addiction led to me working for several porn websites during my twenties.

But then, things changed. I can't explain it but the porn business dried up and I could no longer make a decent living at it anyway. I was still madly addicted but in this time, I felt the wind of the Holy Spirit upon my heart and soul.

I say all of that to say, I know that I know that I was not saved by God until I was 32 years old--years after that moment and past the divorce from my first wife.

But here is the work of the Holy Spirit in my life at a young age: God revealed to me who he was and how my evil, perverted, sick, twisted, sinful dad was not God.

And for me, that realization started when I was seven years old.

I remember one particular day, my dad just finished molesting me and then I went into my room by myself and decided to read my Bible. As I am reading through the Old Testament, something I realized full stop: this God in the Bible is like a Father and He is actually good. My dad is the complete opposite of this. Therefore, God must be who he says he is and by what he does. My dad is evil because of what he says he is and by what he does.

While there is no way my Biblical theology was advanced at the age of seven, I knew several key things in that reading:

**Genesis** God is creator. My dad is not.

**Exodus** God is rescuer. My dad is not.

**Leviticus** God is the righteousness. My dad is not.

**Numbers** God counts us as his own. My dad has no authority in that.

**Deuteronomy** God is holy. My dad is certainly not that.

When I got saved, I often think about those times and see God's hand upon my life.

So here's how I see God the Father according to the Scriptures:

**Joshua** - God is Commander Most High
