**1 Timothy 1:1-2 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,**

**To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.**

## Grace, mercy, and peace

While these three things are exchanged, given, and received between peoples, to receive such things from God is supernatural and continuous for his children and withheld off and on from those who do not trust Him and obey.

I say that to say because God does not grant us grace, mercy, and peace if we choose to sin and rebel. You might push back and say, "But the evil prosper and we sit in poverty". Absolutely true! Jesus affirmed this in Matthew's gospel:

> Matthew 5:43–46 (ESV) “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. **For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.** For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?

Prosperity, health, nor wealth are signs of God's grace. The fact we know and love him is grace from God and not from anything within ourselves.

> Genesis 6:8 (ESV) But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
>
> Genesis 18:3 (ESV) and said, “O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
>
> Psalm 86:6 (ESV) Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace.
>
> Psalm 101:6 (ESV) I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.
>
> Luke 1:30 (ESV) And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
>
> Luke 2:40 (ESV) And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.
>
> John 1:16 (ESV) For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.
>
> Acts 11:23 (ESV) When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,
>
> Romans 5:15 (ESV) But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man’s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.
>
> Romans 16:20 (ESV) The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Amen.

Mercy I have seen in the Scriptures is where we are in anguish, despair, lack, poverty, and hurting and it is the mercy and compassion of the Lord Jesus to deliver us from evil and sin of this world.

> Luke 6:36 (ESV) Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
>
> Ezekiel 39:25 (ESV) “Therefore thus says the Lord God: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name.
>
> Hosea 2:1 (ESV) Say to your brothers, “You are my people,” and to your sisters, “You have received mercy.”
>
> Joel 2:12–14 (ESV) “Yet even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments.” Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster. Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?
>
> Luke 18:13 (ESV) But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’
>
> Romans 9:14–18 (ESV) What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
>
> Luke 18:37–39 (ESV) They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
>
> Ephesians 2:1–10 (ESV) And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

Again, we can give each other peace, or in times of war, a truce. But it is hardly a standstill and it is never permanent. Peace in our post-Genesis 3 sin-filled world is usually the absence of war, chaos, contention, bloodshed.  But in this world, we never have that. At this moment, there is always striving going on. Look at what God gives us:

> Philippians 4:7 (ESV) And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 
>
> Philippians 4:8–9 (ESV) Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. **What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.**
>
> Romans 16:20 (ESV) The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Satan, sin, demons, hell, and death have all been conquered by the Lamb who is worthy.

> Colossians 1:19–20 (ESV) For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,  and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. 
>
> Colossians 2:15 (ESV) He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.
>
> Revelation 1:17–18 (ESV) When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, “Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.

We receive this grace, mercy, and peace, in which our minds can barely comprehend, only because due to the sovereign will of the Father through the perfect life and bloodshed death of His Son by the power of the Holy Spirit *alone*.  Without God, we have nothing. If God does not save us, we are doomed. 

Thanks be to God!
