**Mark 13:28–31 “From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.**

1. **What are “these things” that take place?** (*go back and start at v.5*)  
Leading of the astray, wars, disasters, famine, false christs, sky darkens 

2. **What is the most important thing?**  
The proclamation of the gospel everywhere
