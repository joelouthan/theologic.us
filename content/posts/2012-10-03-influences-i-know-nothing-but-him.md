> I know one thing, that I know nothing.

&#8211; Socrates

If I have set the direction of my theology based on the thread of Hebrews 6:1-3, 1 Corinthians 3:21-23, and 1 Corinthians 2:12-13, then I would have to say this would be the basis for all of my reading, studying, writing, lecturing, preaching, and teaching:

**1 Corinthians 2:2 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.**

Am I going to slip up and give my feeble opinion when I should be pointing to Christ? 

Am I going to run off at the mouth instead of trying to best describe the glories of Christ?

Am I going to present dog poop from the world instead of the vast riches of Christ?

Yep. I can guarantee that is going to happen.

Still, I have nothing to give to God. He alone has made my mind the way it is. He has constructed my personality for his glory (that is still weird to me). He has physically put me together in such a way that my voice booms.

And all that He has done results in me giving glory back to Him. 

That brings Him joy. That brings me joy.

I am not qualify for whatever tasks that he has set out for me. But He called me and He will see it to the end.

I know nothing. However God made me and whatever He gave me is what I do have. I have God. That is way more than I can possibly dream.
