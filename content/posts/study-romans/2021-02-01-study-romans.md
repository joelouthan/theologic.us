So what will this study be? 

Here are some ways it will not be:

1. **In-depth or technical** - Definitely nothing wrong with this method. This is not my strongest suit and I am really not here to impress anybody. I am just here to point you to Christ.
2. **Time-Restraints** - Don't be surprise if I have super short studies. Likewise, it might go long. I want to depend on God for that.
3. **Boggled down in details** - When it comes to theology and doctrine, I have tried to abide in one rule, "Keep the main thing the main thing. Stop majoring in the minors."

So how do we, "Keep the main thing the main thing." So glad you asked:

1. **Devotional** - These studies are intended to be sweet time in connecting with God
2. **Prayerful** - If done correctly, my intention is that this will mark our prayers
3. **Christ-Exalted** - All the Scriptures are about Jesus. This point will be driving into the ground.
4. **Gospel-Centered** - Yes, an over-used term. But if the good news can be proclaimed, we will preach that God saves sinners.
5. **God-glorified** - This is not about your best life now. This is not about 10 ways to do something better. This is not try harder. This is about God and everything that He is and the promises He has fulfilled in Christ by the power of His Spirit.

The format will be simple. Here's a little template that I will be using.

## The Text
What is the text we will be studying today?

## The Support
What, if any, other text supports what we are studying today? (If there is none, then we will won't get bogged down.)

## Our God
What does the text say about God?

## The Gospel
What is the good news?

## Our Responsibility
What do we do now? Or as I like to say, "Where does God's grace have me now?"
