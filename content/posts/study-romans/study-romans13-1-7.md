## The Text

>Romans 13:1–7 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Let everyone submit to the governing authorities, since there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are instituted by God. 

><sup>2</sup> So then, the one who resists the authority is opposing God’s command, and those who oppose it will bring judgment on themselves. 

><sup>3</sup> For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority? Do what is good, and you will have its approval. 

><sup>4</sup> For it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For it is God’s servant, an avenger that brings wrath on the one who does wrong. 

><sup>5</sup> Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath but also because of your conscience. 

><sup>6</sup> And for this reason you pay taxes, since the authorities are God’s servants, continually attending to these tasks. 

><sup>7</sup> Pay your obligations to everyone: taxes to those you owe taxes, tolls to those you owe tolls, respect to those you owe respect, and honor to those you owe honor.

## The Introduction

## Our God

---

><sup>1</sup> Let everyone submit to the governing authorities, since there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are instituted by God. 

### Christ is King: He Has Put All Leaders Over Us

>Daniel 2:21 (CSB) He changes the times and seasons; he removes kings and establishes kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.

---

><sup>2</sup> So then, the one who resists the authority is opposing God’s command, and those who oppose it will bring judgment on themselves. 

### Christ is King: Not To Obey Leaders is Bringing Judgment Upon Ourselves

>Mark 10:42–43 (CSB) Jesus called them over and said to them, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions act as tyrants over them. But it is not so among you. On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant,

>Acts 5:29 (CSB) Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.

>Daniel 6:7-9 (CSB) All the administrators of the kingdom — the prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors — have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an edict that, for thirty days, anyone who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions’ den. Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict and sign the document so that, as a law of the Medes and Persians, it is irrevocable and cannot be changed.” So King Darius signed the written edict.

><sup>3</sup> For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority? Do what is good, and you will have its approval.

### Christ is King: No Law Against Good

>Galatians 5:22-23 (CSB) But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The law is not against such things.

Less Ten Commandments = More Laws to Govern

><sup>4</sup> For it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For it is God’s servant, an avenger that brings wrath on the one who does wrong. 

### Christ is King: He is King of kings

><sup>5</sup> Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath but also because of your conscience.

### Christ is King: He rules over our hearts

---

><sup>6-7</sup> And for this reason you pay taxes, since the authorities are God’s servants, continually attending to these tasks. Pay your obligations to everyone: taxes to those you owe taxes, tolls to those you owe tolls, respect to those you owe respect, and honor to those you owe honor.

### Christ is King: Give Caesar's what is Caesar's

>Matthew 22:21 (CSB) They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

>Acts 2:43-47 (CSB) Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles. Now all the believers were together and held all things in common. They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as any had need. Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.
