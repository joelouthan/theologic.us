## The Text

<sup>18</sup> For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth, <sup>19</sup> since what can be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them. <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being understood through what he has made. As a result, people are without excuse. <sup>21</sup> For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. <sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore God delivered them over in the desires of their hearts to sexual impurity, so that their bodies were degraded among themselves. <sup>25</sup> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served what has been created instead of the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen.
