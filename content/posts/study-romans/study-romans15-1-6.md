## The Text

>Romans 15:1–6 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves. 

><sup>2</sup> Each one of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 

><sup>3</sup> For even Christ did not please himself. On the contrary, as it is written, The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. 

><sup>4</sup> For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the Scriptures. 

><sup>5</sup> Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus, 

><sup>6</sup> so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one voice.

## Our God

><sup>1-2</sup> Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves. Each one of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 

### Encourage Boldly: Lift each other up

>Ephesians 2:8–10 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. **For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.**

Consider the words of Christ in the John's gospel:

>John 13:14-15 (CSB) So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done for you.

>John 13:34-35 (CSB) “I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

>John 15:12-17 (CSB) “This is my command: Love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this: to lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me, but I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you. “This is what I command you: Love one another.

Remember, the Bible is built on loving God and loving one another.

For those who are struggling with doubt, weakened by sin, destroyed by the sin of others, or simply overwhelmed by the world, this is where we get to weep with those who weep. It might be an encouraging word or a simple act of love. It might just sit and hang out in silence and not knowing what tomorrow holds but just the fact we know that we have each other and we are not alone.

You do not need to be alone. I am not talking about dating or marriage or even best friends. I am willing to wager a great sum that that there is not one person who will read this who does not have access to a local church. American, I speaking to you with churches on every corner. Make the effort. Find a church. Be known by others and let others know you.

But you are not alone. And if you are suffer from depression and anxiety, you can't make it to church, let your church family know so we can sit with you and keep you company. You are not alone. Suffering from addiction? You are not alone. Ask one person for help and watch what happens.

You are not by yourself.

Likewise, people who have people, check on others who don't have people. The local church is the preaching of God to the heavenly authorities on how he planned out his great gospel:

>Ephesians 3:8-13 (CSB) This grace was given to me — the least of all the saints — to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things. This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens. This is according to his eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him we have boldness and confident access through faith in him. So, then, I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory.

The local church is a great gift. Take full advantage of that great gift of God.

><sup>3</sup> For even Christ did not please himself. On the contrary, as it is written, The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. 

### Encourage Boldly: Christ went to the cross with great joy

>Hebrews 12:1-2 (ESV) Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, **who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.**

And

>Philippians 2:5-8 (CSB)   
>Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus,  
>who, existing in the form of God,  
>did not consider equality with God  
>as something to be exploited.  
>Instead he emptied himself  
>by assuming the form of a servant,  
>taking on the likeness of humanity.  
>And when he had come as a man,  
>he humbled himself by becoming obedient  
>to the point of death —  
>even to death on a cross.

In the pain and agony of the cross, Christ did it all so that he would save his people from their sins.

In that salvation, he let go of all his rights and privileges and gave his life over so that we could live.

Because he died and rose again, we not only live but we get to build up one another.

><sup>4</sup> For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the Scriptures.

### Encourage Boldly: the mouth of God speaks to you for you

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

>Romans 5:1–5 (CSB) Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. **We have also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope. This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.**

The Scriptures testify all about Christ. (Luke 24:27) But whom are they testify to? Who is the audience? Who was it intended for?

You. This is the voice of God for you. This is the words of God for you. For:

>2 Timothy 3:16–17 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

If the Scriptures are the mouth of God, is it any wonder that we are called to preach the word of God? For:

>2 Timothy 4:1–5 (CSB) I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom: **Preach the word**; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

## Our Response

><sup>5-6</sup> Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus, so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one voice.

### Encourage Boldly: Be encouraged by all that God has done for us

Within the local church, the preaching of the word of God is the primary means of grace. That is to say it is penultimate. Nothing is above preaching of the Bible. We are called together to worship God and within the worship, we get to sit under the preaching of the sweet assurance of the gospel for our hearts and souls and minds. We get to hear the voice of God for us.

Praise be to God!
