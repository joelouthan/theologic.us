>Romans 11:16-32 (CSB)  
><sup>16</sup> Now if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. 

><sup>17</sup> Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, 

><sup>18</sup> do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you. 

><sup>19</sup> Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 

><sup>20</sup> True enough; they were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but beware, 

><sup>21</sup> because if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 

><sup>22</sup> Therefore, consider God’s kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen but God’s kindness toward you—if you remain in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. 

><sup>23</sup> And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again. 

><sup>24</sup> For if you were cut off from your native wild olive tree and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these—the natural branches—be grafted into their own olive tree? 

><sup>25</sup> I don’t want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you will not be conceited: A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. 

><sup>26</sup> And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. 

><sup>27</sup> And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. 

><sup>28</sup> Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of the patriarchs, 

><sup>29</sup> since God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable. 

><sup>30</sup> As you once disobeyed God but now have received mercy through their disobedience, 

><sup>31</sup> so they too have now disobeyed, resulting in mercy to you, so that they also may now receive mercy. 

><sup>32</sup> For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may have mercy on all.
