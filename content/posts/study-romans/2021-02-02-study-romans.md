# The Text

Romans 1:1–7 (CSB) Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God— which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures— concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh  and was appointed to be the powerful Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection of the dead.  Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles,  including you who are also called by Jesus Christ.  To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## The Support

Paul, a servant ofr Christ Jesus, called as an apotle and set apart for the gospel of God - 1 Tim 1:12-17

which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning his Son - the Old Testament - Isaiah 53

who was descended from David - Matthew 1, Luke 4, Davidic covanent, Jeremiah blood curse

according to the flesh - John 1:1-14; Romans 8:1-4

and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord - Romans 8:12-13; John 3:35 The fFather loves the Son and has given all things into his hand (Daniel 7; Hebrews 1:1-2)

thought whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among the nations - Great Commission - Matt 28; Mark 16, Luke 24, Acts 1, John 21, Romans 15

including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ - ((reference calling))

To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## God

Sent his Son to save - Matt 1:21

Did so by the power of the Holy Spirit - Luke 3 unto Luke 4; John 3:34 For whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.

## The Gospel

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever shall believe in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.

The opposite is also true; v36: Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (2 Cor 5:21)

## Our Responsibility

Trust in God. Nothing on this earth. "Let the things of earth grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace."

"On Christ's glory I would fix all of my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ , the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy."
John Owen. The Glory of Christ.
