## The Text

**Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God—<sup>2</sup> which he promised beforehand  through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures—<sup>3</sup> concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David, according to the flesh <sup>4</sup> and was appointed to be the powerful Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection of the dead. <sup>5</sup> Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, <sup>6</sup> including you who are also called by Jesus Christ.**

**<sup>7</sup> To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.**
