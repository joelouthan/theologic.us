Let us continue:

Five, the gospel **which he promised beforehand through his prophets**. You have seen and heard this a million times and you will a million more. The gospel, that is, the good news of God, first explicitly preached by God himself while he walked the cool of the garden looking for his lost children. His children, Adam and Eve, our first parents, believed not God for his righteousness but believed Satan for our own self-righteousness. In the moment they disobeyed God in their hearts is the moment they began to died. In that dying, feelings like anxiety, fear, doubt, worry, trespass, shame, guilt, and sin overwhelmed them. Like all children of disobedience, they ran away, hid, and covered up with blame-shifting and self-righteousness.

But God, being rich in mercy, sought them both, and his precious saving grace fell upon them. While Satan twisted the promises of God directly to Eve while her husband looked on, God turns to Satan and delivers his judgment while Adam and Eve saw and heard:

> I will put enmity between you and the woman,  
and between your offspring and her offspring;  
he shall bruise your head,  
and you shall bruise his heel.
 
And we know that Adam and Eve both heard and believe God's counter-reality good news because God *made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.* In other words and stop me if this sounds familiar, God sacrificed a living animal and covered His children's own wickedness, shame, and self-righteousness with something only He could have done.

And the prophets continues to beat that same drum with the same rhythm over and over again until God's own son, Jesus Christ, who lived and sacrificed his own life so that we hear His good news, believe in Him and be covered with His own spotless clothes. 

Six, God's gospel, **in the holy Scriptures concerning his Son**, that is, Jesus Christ. Simply put, and this statement cannot be overemphasized, that the Scriptures are about Jesus Christ our Lord. You guys know what I am going to mention next:

> Luke 24:25-27 And he said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!  Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?  And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.  

To read the Bible in another context is a fool's errand and doing so, will not give anybody life. If you go searching the Scriptures trying to find the one thing to save you and you don't come back with the unequivical answer of Jesus Christ, go back and look again. Only this time, plead with the Holy Spirit of God to open your eyes so that you might see and open your mind so that you would understand and bathe in his glory and grace.

Seven, Jesus Christ, **who was descended from David**. Let me say something shocking: Jesus Christ was Jewish. He was Jewish as the day is long. And he was a double down Jew with a Jewish mom and an adopted Jewish dad, whom both were descended straight from David. So he was not only a descendant of David once over, but a descendant twice over. (Why? We will cover this in Luke 3. If you can't wait for the spoiler, research: "Christ lineage of David blood curse Jeremiah") Remember where you've read in the Bible where God doesn't break his promises--like all of the Bible? Part of the Messianic promise is that our Savior would be Jewish.

Not Roman. Not Greek. Not American. Not *whatever empire God allowed to be in power at the time*. No, a born Jew.

A little baby boy out of a rural town in Israel (not unlike a place like Rosedale, OK). Not glorious in splendor. But dirt poor. Not wealthy king and queen but a dad who didn't know what the heck and a teenage mom.  Out of a people group who God called:

> Deuteronomy 7:6-8 For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.  It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,  but it is because the Lord loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 

Not the mightiest. But the tiniest nation. So that they (and by that, I mean, we) could never say, "Look at what we have done" but worship and praise the worthy God and sing, "Look at what He has done for us!"

Eight, Jesus Christ, **according to the flesh**. Now that's an odd statement. Did Paul derail here? Not at all. We stated before that God is not restrained and restricted to his own creation including time and space. So there is nothing stopping God because God is above all.

Furthermore, God is not restricted and restrained by anything we have done--includes sin. Let me rant for a mere moment. We have to divorce this idea in our heads that God is not nearly as powerful because he lacks the ability to do certain things. Okay, God lacks to ability to **sin and die**.  Our ability to sin and die does not trump and controls God in any ways. I know that might sounds like ridiculous but I just want to clear that up before moving on.

Now that said, the author of Hebrews sums up the sacrificial system of worship and the holiness of God in this way: **Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.**

Now, sin has been committed by mankind and it is **only** mankind that can atone for sin. But wait, we have all read Genesis, Exodus, Levitius, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, right? We know for a fact that the sacrifice for sin must be perfect, spotless, and without blemish. Not just on the outside and but on the inside. "But wait," you might say, "we used to sacrifice bulls and goats and lambs, let us keep doing that."

and was declared to be the Son of God 

in power according to the Spirit of holiness 

by his resurrection from the dead

Jesus Christ our Lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship 

to bring about the obedience of faith 

for the sake of his name 

among all the nations

including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,
