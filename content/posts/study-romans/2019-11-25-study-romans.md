which he promised beforehand through his prophets 

in the holy Scriptures

concerning his Son

who was descended from David 

according to the flesh 

and was declared to be the Son of God 

in power according to the Spirit of holiness 

by his resurrection from the dead

Jesus Christ our Lord

through whom 

we have received grace 

and apostleship 

to bring about the obedience of faith 

for the sake of his name 

among all the nations

including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,**


II. Who are we?
To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.**
