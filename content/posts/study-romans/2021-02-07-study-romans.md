## The Text

<sup>26</sup> For this reason God delivered them over to disgraceful passions. Their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. <sup>27</sup> The men in the same way also left natural relations with women and were inflamed in their lust for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the appropriate penalty of their error.

<sup>28</sup> And because they did not think it worthwhile to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right. <sup>29</sup> They are filled with all unrighteousness, evil, greed, and wickedness. They are full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, <sup>30</sup> slanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <sup>31</sup> senseless, untrustworthy, unloving, and unmerciful. <sup>32</sup> Although they know God’s just sentence—that those who practice such things deserve to die,—they not only do them, but even applaud, others who practice them.
