## The Text

>Romans 5:6–11 (CSB)  
><sup> 6 </sup> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 

><sup> 7 </sup> For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 

><sup> 8 </sup> But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 

><sup> 9 </sup> How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 

><sup> 11 </sup> And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

## Our God

><sup> 6 </sup> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

### Our Helpless Estate

>Psalms 22:6 (CSB) But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by people.

>1 Chronicles 29:14 (CSB) But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your own hand.

>Ephesians 2:1 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins

>Titus 3:3 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.

><sup> 7 </sup> For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.

## Our Response

><sup> 10 </sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 

### No longer at war with God, but peace through his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ

><sup> 11 </sup> And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

### We have been fully reconciled to God

>2 Corinthians 5:17–21 (CSB)  
><sup> 17 </sup> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, and see, the new has come! 

><sup> 18 </sup> Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 

><sup> 19 </sup> That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed the message of reconciliation to us. 

><sup> 20 </sup> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us. We plead on Christ’s behalf, “Be reconciled to God.” 

><sup> 21 </sup> He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
