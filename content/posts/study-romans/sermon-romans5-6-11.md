## The Text

>Romans 5:6–11 (CSB)  
><sup> 6 </sup> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 

><sup> 7 </sup> For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 

><sup> 8 </sup> But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 

><sup> 9 </sup> How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 

><sup> 11 </sup> And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

## Our God

### Our Helpless Estate

Worm not a man
1 Cor 29
Dead in our trespasses
once foolish

### Far from God

laying down ones life
  stipulations
  earn trust
  take a bullet

## The Gospel

### While we were yet sinners

### While we were yet enemies

## Our Response

### Boast in nothing else

### We have been fully reconciled to God

2 Cor 5:17-21
