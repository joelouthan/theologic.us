## The Text

>Romans 5:6–11 (CSB)  
><sup> 6 </sup> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 

><sup> 7 </sup> For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 

><sup> 8 </sup> But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 

><sup> 9 </sup> How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 

><sup> 11 </sup> And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

## The Introduction

How did we get here?

This passage does not hang by itself. In other words, is not a standalone passage. Even though I am preaching just this passage, I will need the full council of God which is completely and perfectly contained in this Book concerning all things necessary for God's glory and our salvation.

Why would I be so bold in saying that?

The 1689 Second London Baptist Confession states it this way in Chapter 1, Part 6: 

>>The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture

Confession is certainly not Scripture. But our Confessions are simply doctrine--what the Bible teaches.

We know that the Bible does completely teach what is necessary for the glory of God and what is necessary for our salvation because the authors who were inspired by the Author who is the Holy Spirit say so.

Paul drills this point on anything outside of Scriptures concerning our salvation:

>Galatians 1:8–9 (CSB) But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, a curse be on him! As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!

Paul tells the young Pastor Timothy concerning our faith and life as Timothy shepherds the church in Ephesus :

>2 Timothy 3:14-17 (CSB) But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you, and you know that from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

Finally, out of the mouth of Christ concerning his great glory during his earthly ministry:

>John 6:45 (CSB) It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to me—

When I say I need the full council of God, that is, all of the Bible, to preach to you today, what this particular passage of Scripture means, I mean what I say. And if I need it, so do you.

We learned last week in Bible study in Chad Bird's "The Christ Key" that everything starts with the Torah--the first five books of the Bible--and then Historical, Prophets, and the Writings and finally, the New Testament builds upon that. We don't have the time to walk through the entire Bible but this Romans passage is in the middle of Romans.

So using all Romans, how did we get here? What did Paul say before saying this wonderful thing in chapter 5 verses 6 through 11? How did he build his case?

### A Walkthrough of Romans

- **Romans 1:1-17 the Gospel of God** - Paul starts with glorifying God and his affections for the church in Rome. Which let me remind each of us what the city of Rome was like in the first century: a hot bed of depravity and idolatry--which the citizens of Rome were masters at the time of mixing and integrating sin and the worship of other gods. Wickedness, social injustices, political corruption. How does Paul respond in his letter to the church? Justification by faith alone. Incredible.

>Romans 1:16–17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

- **Romans 1:18-32 The Depravity of Man** - Paul blatantly states we need the gospel because of our own depravity. And if you want to a gut puncher, read verses 18 all the way to verse 32.  

>Romans 1:32 (CSB) Although they know God’s just sentence—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do them, but even applaud others who practice them.

- Romans 2 God gives law
- Romans 3 No one is righteous. No not one.
- Romans 3:21-26 we are justified freely by his grace-saints of the OT and NT alike
- Romans 3:27-31 The law does not save us
- Romans 4:1-8 We do not put God into our debt
- Romans 4:9-25 We are saved by faith alone
- Romans 5:1-5 Since we have Christ, we even get to boast and take joy in our afflictions

>Romans 5:1–5 (CSB) Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. We have also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope. This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

>James 1:2-3 (CSB) Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.

Boast in our afflictions? Consider it a great joy for trials and tribulations? Who needs tribulations? Isn't life hard enough as is?

Character and endurance? What is God preparing us for?

To answer that question, you got to start again from the beginning.

## Our God

><sup> 6 </sup> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

### Future Sin Future Grace: Our Helpless Estate

>>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
>>Let this blest assurance control
>>That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
>>And has shed His own blood for my soul
>>
>>Horatio Spafford. It Is Well With My Soul.

>Isaiah 6:1–5 (CSB) In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies; his glory fills the whole earth. The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke. Then I said: Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips, and because my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Armies.

>Psalms 22:6 (CSB) But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by people.

>1 Chronicles 29:14 (CSB) But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your own hand.

>Ephesians 2:1 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins

>Titus 3:3 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.

The Christian comes upon seeing the glory and beauty and the holiness of God and just becomes undone. Now you and I might have the Paul's Road to Damascus radical transformation. Some do. Others might have been like C.S. Lewis who just gets on their motorcycle and at the end of a very short drive, just believes and trust in God. 

But we are all undone in one way or another at the sight of God and the beauty of his grace and gospel. And once you see it, you are never the same. You can't go back to what you once was. 

In that moment when you were saved by God, you felt helpless. Insecure. Fearful. Shaky ground. Like Paul cries out, "Wretched man that I am! Who is going to save me from this body of sin and death!" Or like the tax collector, standing in the back of the sanctuary, beating his chest and crying out, "Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner!"

It was there when God saved you completely unto himself. For good. You and I as sinners in the sight of God are helpless--you wanna say as babies--but even babies breath and live. We were helpless and dead corpses at the bottom of the ocean. Who is going to save us?

><sup> 7 </sup> For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 

### Future Sin Future Grace: Far From God

I am going on a short limb to say that I don't think anybody here has ever been in a situation where you put yourself in danger in order of someone else to live. If you have, share with us afterwards because that would be an awesome story.

I was a kid of the 80s where I was constantly exposed to the greatest movie genre ever to be invented: The Action Movie! And man, you saw so many movies where someone gives their own life so someone else would live, that you grew up thinking, "Man, this is just life for now on. Just psych yourself to take one for the team."

And I am a US Air Force vet. I didn't see action like that.

And in these action movies, it was someone being saved was if not a good person, at least someone redeemable. 

But life is not an action movie. As awesome as it might sound, we do not live in constant danger with bullets whizzing by our heads every second of the day. 

But this life is certainly not an action movie because the ones needing to be saved--you and I--were not good in the sight of God and by own strength, could not redeem ourselves. 

You see what Christ did here?

><sup> 6b </sup> at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

Let me give it to you in another the way--the good news...

## The Gospel

><sup> 8 </sup> But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

### But God

Let us start off here. Who is God? 

Is God like us? No. He is far from us. For his good and worthy and holy and righteous and perfect. If you ever wanted a clearer picture, I encourage you all to read John Stott's Cross of Christ. Starting on page 107, Stott lists out 5 ways, because just the reason of sin, how we are not God:

- He is high above our sin and idolatry
- He is far from our wickedness and depravity
- He is glorious - He shines the brightest

>Revelation 22:5 (CSB) Night will be no more; people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever.

>>I am in sweet communion with Christ as a poor sinner can be; and am only pained that he hath much beauty and fairness, and I little love; he great power and mercy, and I little faith; he much light and I bleared eyes.
>>Samuel Rutherford. The Loveliness of Christ.

- He is rejects all sin from his presence - no toleration, does not have to live with it
- 

Does God have good and bad days and whatever life circumstances give him, he deals with accordingly? No. In actuality, he is completely sovereign over all circumstances. Things don't happen to him unless he allows it. That makes him omnipotent--which is a fancy way of calling him, Almighty.

## Our Response

><sup> 10 </sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 

### No longer at war with God, but peace through his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ

---

><sup> 11 </sup> And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

### We have been fully reconciled to God

>2 Corinthians 5:17–21 (CSB)  
><sup> 17 </sup> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, and see, the new has come! 

><sup> 18 </sup> Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 

><sup> 19 </sup> That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed the message of reconciliation to us. 

><sup> 20 </sup> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us. We plead on Christ’s behalf, “Be reconciled to God.” 

><sup> 21 </sup> He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
