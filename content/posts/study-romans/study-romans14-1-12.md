## The Text

>Romans 14:1–12 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Welcome anyone who is weak in faith, but don’t argue about disputed matters. 

><sup>2</sup> One person believes he may eat anything, while one who is weak eats only vegetables. 

><sup>3</sup> One who eats must not look down on one who does not eat, and one who does not eat must not judge one who does, because God has accepted him. 

><sup>4</sup> Who are you to judge another’s household servant? Before his own Lord he stands or falls. And he will stand, because the Lord is able to make him stand. 

><sup>5</sup> One person judges one day to be more important than another day. Someone else judges every day to be the same. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind. 

><sup>6</sup> Whoever observes the day, observes it for the honor of the Lord. Whoever eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and whoever does not eat, it is for the Lord that he does not eat it, and he gives thanks to God. 

><sup>7</sup> For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. 

><sup>8</sup> If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 

><sup>9</sup> Christ died and returned to life for this: that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living. 

><sup>10</sup> But you, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 

><sup>11</sup> For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God. 

><sup>12</sup> So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.

## The Introduction

## Our God

><sup>1-3</sup> Welcome anyone who is weak in faith, but don’t argue about disputed matters. One person believes he may eat anything, while one who is weak eats only vegetables. One who eats must not look down on one who does not eat, and one who does not eat must not judge one who does, because God has accepted him. 

### Live According to Conscience: Your maturity and sanctification was not of your own doing

>Hebrews 6:1–3 (CSB) Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God, teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. **And we will do this if God permits.**

><sup>4-5</sup> Who are you to judge another’s household servant? Before his own Lord he stands or falls. And he will stand, because the Lord is able to make him stand. One person judges one day to be more important than another day. Someone else judges every day to be the same. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind. 

### Live According to Conscience: We are weak but he is strong

>2 Corinthians 12:9–10 (CSB) But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may reside in me. So I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and in difficulties, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

><sup>6</sup> Whoever observes the day, observes it for the honor of the Lord. Whoever eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and whoever does not eat, it is for the Lord that he does not eat it, and he gives thanks to God.

### Live According to Conscience: All things come from God

---

><sup>7-8</sup> For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.

### Live According to Conscience: We belong to the Lord

---

><sup>9</sup> Christ died and returned to life for this: that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living. 

### Live According to Conscience: Christ judges the living and the dead

---

## Our Response

><sup>10-12</sup> But you, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God. So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.

### Live According to Conscience: We will all stand before the judgment seat of God

>Romans 8:14–17 (CSB) For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
