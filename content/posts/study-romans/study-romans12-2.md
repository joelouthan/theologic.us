## Our God

### Ours to Do: Do not be conformed to this age

>Colossians 2:8 (CSB) Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition, based on the elements of the world, rather than Christ.

## The Gospel

### Ours to Do: Be transformed by the renewing of your mind

>1 Corinthians 1:18–25 (CSB)  
><sup>18</sup> For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God to us who are being saved. 

><sup>19</sup> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the intelligence of the intelligent. 

><sup>20</sup> Where is the one who is wise? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn’t God made the world’s wisdom foolish? 

><sup>21</sup> For since, in God’s wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of what is preached. 

><sup>22</sup> For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks seek wisdom, 

><sup>23</sup> but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles. 

><sup>24</sup> Yet to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, 

><sup>25</sup> because God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.

And

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

And

>1 Corinthians 12:1–3 (CSB) Now concerning spiritual gifts: brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be unaware. You know that when you were pagans, you used to be enticed and led astray by mute idols. Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

## Our Response

### Ours to Do: Discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. 

>Ephesians 5:6–14 (CSB) Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s wrath is coming on the disobedient because of these things. Therefore, do not become their partners. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light—for the fruit of the light consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth—testing what is pleasing to the Lord. Don’t participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret. Everything exposed by the light is made visible, for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.

>Philippians 4:8 (CSB) Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any moral excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—dwell on these things.

>Colossians 1:9–14 (CSB) For this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven’t stopped praying for you. We are asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance and patience, joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light. He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves. In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
