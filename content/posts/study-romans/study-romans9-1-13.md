>Lamentations 3:22–23 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness!

## The Text

>Romans 9:1–13 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit—

><sup>2</sup> that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 

><sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood. 

><sup>4</sup> They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises. 

><sup>5</sup> The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen. 

><sup>6</sup> Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 

><sup>7</sup> Neither is it the case that all of Abraham’s children are his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. 

><sup>8</sup> That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring. 

><sup>9</sup> For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son. 

><sup>10</sup> And not only that, but Rebekah conceived children through one man, our father Isaac. 

><sup>11</sup> For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to election might stand—

><sup>12</sup> not from works but from the one who calls—she was told, The older will serve the younger. 

><sup>13</sup> As it is written: I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.

## The Introduction

Romans 8:38-39

There is no 1 Romans and 2 Romans 

Romans 9-11 is perfect where it is at

Israelites were given the law and not all

Remnant of Israel is the church—gentile believers were always grafted in

Christ is the fulfillment of all the covenants including and especially Genesis 12. 

God gave the land to Israelites. God gives himself as a dwelling place for his people 

Seek him and you will find him

Being born a Jew was good enough. Sons of Abraham were really sons of the devil. 

Christ says you must be born again. You can’t do that, God must make you a new. 

><sup>1</sup> I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit—

><sup>2</sup> that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 

><sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood.
