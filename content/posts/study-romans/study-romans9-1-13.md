## The Text

>Romans 9:1–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit—

><sup> 2  </sup>that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 

><sup> 3  </sup>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood. 

><sup> 4  </sup>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises. 

><sup> 5  </sup>The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen. 

><sup> 6  </sup>Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Neither is it the case that all of Abraham’s children are his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. 

><sup> 8  </sup>That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring. 

><sup> 9  </sup>For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son. 

><sup> 10  </sup>And not only that, but Rebekah conceived children through one man, our father Isaac. 

><sup> 11  </sup>For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to election might stand—

><sup> 12  </sup>not from works but from the one who calls—she was told, The older will serve the younger. 

><sup> 13  </sup>As it is written: I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.
