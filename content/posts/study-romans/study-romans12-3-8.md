## The Text

>Romans 12:3-8 (CSB)  
><sup>3</sup> For by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. 

><sup>4</sup> Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, 

><sup>5</sup> in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. 

><sup>6</sup> According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts: If prophecy, use it according to the proportion of one’s faith; 

><sup>7</sup> if service, use it in service; if teaching, in teaching; 

><sup>8</sup> if exhorting, in exhortation; giving, with generosity; leading, with diligence; showing mercy, with cheerfulness.

## The Introduction

When I said that Paul had many commands for us to do, I was not kidding. See what God has done in Romans 1-11 and now go and do (12-16). But what I cannot overemphasize is the order of what just happened: God does, we respond.

God saves. Let us worship.

God has changed us from the inside out. Let us think differently.

Now, let us reflect on this passage: God loves, let us love one another.

>1 John 4:7–8 (CSB) Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

How do we do this? There are nearly infinite ways of showing the love of God towards others. And the others in this, I cannot overstate based on the crystal clarity of our Lord Jesus in his parable on the Good Samaritan:

>Luke 10:36–37 (CSB) “Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?” “The one who showed mercy to him,” he said. Then Jesus told him, “Go and do the same.”

Go and give mercy--not because this other person is your friend. Go and give mercy to everyone because God has given you great mercy. Not only to be thankful but to be empowered to give the same mercy to others in the way he has given it to you.

## Our God

><sup>3b</sup>I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think.

### Love One Another: Don't Think of Yourself Too Highly

Let's start from the jump: humble yourself. For:

>James 4:6–10 (CSB) But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says: God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. **Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.**

Friends, we see in the word of God that you have done nothing but receive the favor and grace of God. You have not done anything to earn so you cannot boast. TODO:

Personality tests, etc.

In the end, where is the focus? How many of us worry less and do less overthinking and stumble less when we focus more on ourselves. Nobody does. And the real evil: become so enthrall with yourself, you start to believe that this your world and everything and everyone revolves around you.

Navel-gazing and narcissistic tendencies have you looking at yourself who is hopeless and weak to save yourself and away from the only God who is infinite in might, glory and worth.

Easier said than done. TODO:

><sup>3c</sup>Instead, think sensibly

### Love One Another: Think Sensibly

>Romans 12:2 (CSB) Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. 

---

><sup>3d</sup>God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. 

### Love One Another: God Gives Faith

>Ephesians 2:8–9 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast.

>Romans 1:17 (CSB) For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

><sup>4a</sup> Now as we have many parts in one body,

### Love One Another: Christ is the Head of the Body

><sup>4b</sup> and all the parts do not have the same function, 

### Love One Another: We are Built Differently

---

><sup>5</sup> in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. 

### Love One Another: We Belong to One Another

## Our Response

><sup>6</sup> According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts: If prophecy, use it according to the proportion of one’s faith; 

><sup>7</sup> if service, use it in service; if teaching, in teaching; 

><sup>8</sup> if exhorting, in exhortation; giving, with generosity; leading, with diligence; showing mercy, with cheerfulness.

### Love One Another: This is Ministry

**Prophecy** - not predicting or foretelling the future-- that new age and witchcraft and occult

Yet, preaching and at the very least, encouraging one another because all of what God has done in Christ for us.

Examples TODO:

**proportion of one's faith**  - you just have to have more faith. What if you don't? Then you must really not be saved.

Yet

tiniest faiths TODO:

**Service**

**Teaching**

**Exhortation** earnestly address or urging

**Giving with generosity**

**leading, with diligence**

**mercy, with cheerfulness**

><sup>3a</sup> For by the grace given to me

### Love One Another: For By the Grace That Was Given to Me
