## The Text

>Romans 12:1–8 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship. 

><sup>2</sup> Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. 

><sup>3</sup> For by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. 

><sup>4</sup> Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, 

><sup>5</sup> in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. 

><sup>6</sup> According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts: If prophecy, use it according to the proportion of one’s faith; 

><sup>7</sup> if service, use it in service; if teaching, in teaching; 

><sup>8</sup> if exhorting, in exhortation; giving, with generosity; leading, with diligence; showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
