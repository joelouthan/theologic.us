## The Text

>Romans 11:16-24 (CSB)  
><sup>16</sup> Now if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. 

><sup>17</sup> Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, 

><sup>18</sup> do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you. 

><sup>19</sup> Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 

><sup>20</sup> True enough; they were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but beware, 

><sup>21</sup> because if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 

><sup>22</sup> Therefore, consider God’s kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen but God’s kindness toward you—if you remain in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. 

><sup>23</sup> And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again. 

><sup>24</sup> For if you were cut off from your native wild olive tree and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these—the natural branches—be grafted into their own olive tree? 

## The Introduction

- 22 we are the vessels of mercy
- 23 if you are far, you can be a part of this - you hear the assurance because of Christ has done - you can hve a part of this! This is for the taking. Even if you struggle with doubt and despair, that does not weaken the God's almighty double snatch grip of the Father and Son on your life

### God is Merciful--Receive It: For It Is Not Of Yourselves But Of God

### God is Merciful--Receive It: We Are Not Born Into This But of God

>John 1:12–13 (CSB) But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

- wild origins of Gentiles
  - Adam
  - Lot
  - Ishmael
  - Rahab
  - Ruth
- root of Jews - Abraham
  - root of us - Christ
  - Gal 3 - Abraham is root of faith
- Gentiles - set apart by God for particularness for Israel (Deut 7) but **always** grafted in by faith since Abraham

><sup>18</sup> do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you. 

><sup>19</sup> Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 

### God is Merciful--Receive It: Your Works Did Not Save You But God

>Titus 3:3–5 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.

- 18-19 not a zerosum game; the beat down of self-confidence and self-righteousness - filthiness before God - God saw you in your sinfulness not in your righteousness Romans 5:8. He saw that you could not save yourself. That is why he sent his Son--because he alone is good and he alone saves
