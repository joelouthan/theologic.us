>Lamentations 3:22–23 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness!

## The Text

>Romans 9:14–23 (CSB)  
><sup>14</sup> What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 

><sup>15</sup> For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 

><sup>16</sup> So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. 

><sup>17</sup> For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. 

><sup>18</sup> So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 

><sup>19</sup> You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?” 

><sup>20</sup> On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” 

><sup>21</sup> Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? 

><sup>22</sup> And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 

><sup>23</sup> And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory—
