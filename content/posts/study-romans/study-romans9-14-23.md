>**Lamentations 3:22–23 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness!**

## The Text

>Romans 9:14–23 (CSB)  
><sup>14</sup> What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 

><sup>15</sup> For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 

><sup>16</sup> So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. 

><sup>17</sup> For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. 

><sup>18</sup> So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 

><sup>19</sup> You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?” 

><sup>20</sup> On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” 

><sup>21</sup> Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? 

><sup>22</sup> And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 

><sup>23</sup> And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory—

## The Introduction

><sup>14</sup> What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly just

To understand anything about God--that is his love, mercy, grace, salvation, election--we must understand that God is perfectly just.

In the 1689 Chapter 2.1, among all the attributes of God like

>>most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him

perfectly and without conflict coincide with:

>>and withal most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

Our world cannot fathom this. That we hate sin and therefore we are judgmental and hate those who commit sins that either we don't struggle with or it is the sin that we absolute struggle with. I am quick to point out and be upset when some guy is acting like a jerk but that is me. I am that jerkwad.

Or someone struggles with a particular sin and you look down your nose at them because by God's sheer grace, you don't struggle with that sin--yet, you might catch yourself thinking you are better than them. (For the uninformed, that is pride.)

Yet, this is what makes God so mysterious. God is fully love and compassionate and kind and yet "**withal most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty**." In other words, God absolutely get to have it both ways.

Because God is holy and without sin, he must be just. We beg him to be just against those who do us harm but when we harm, we beg for mercy.

><sup>15</sup> For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly merciful

We might all be familiar with the story of Noah. But let us start with Genesis 6 verse 1 and see the state of mankind before evoking the right judgment of God.

>Genesis 6:1–8 (CSB) When mankind began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of mankind were beautiful, and they took any they chose as wives for themselves. And the LORD said, “My Spirit will not remain with mankind forever, because they are corrupt. Their days will be 120 years.” The Nephilim were on the earth both in those days and afterward, when the sons of God came to the daughters of mankind, who bore children to them. They were the powerful men of old, the famous men. When the LORD saw that human wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time, the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and he was deeply grieved. Then the LORD said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I created, off the face of the earth, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky—for I regret that I made them.” 

Read that passage again. Whom was corrupt? Who was wickedness? How bad did it get? Did some or every inclination of the human mind was towards evil?

>Noah...

Stop right there. This is not a trick question. What Noah human? Was he part of mankind.

Now before this point, what did we just read? If Noah was man and man was corrupt, wicked, and the mind of man was bent and thought evil all the time...

Was Noah wicked?

Was Noah corrupt?

Did Noah think evil thoughts continually?

Go back to Romans 9:15. What did he tell Moses?

>I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 

What did Noah do to deserve mercy? What did Noah do to deserve compassion?

Forget what you might heard in Sunday School. Remember the gospel.

>Romans 3:23 (CSB) For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;

Did God regret making Noah? He absolutely did.

Could God rightfully wipe Noah off the face of the earth? He would be well within his rights.

But look at our God

>Genesis 6:8 (CSB) Noah, however, found favor with the LORD.

God gave Noah his grace. Doesn't that sound familiar? Yes, that is what we call the good news of God! That is the gospel of God!

Noah was just as wicked as everybody around him. But for no reason other than the sovereign grace of our great Lord, he saved Noah.

>Titus 3:3–5 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.

If we know that gospel is true and that the Scriptures do not contradict one another, then what happened to Noah after God gave him saving grace? You know the gospel.

Read on in Genesis 6:

>Genesis 6:9 (CSB) These are the family records of Noah. **Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God.**

Noah did not earn his salvation. For:

>Romans 3:10–12 (CSB) as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away; all alike have become worthless. There is no one who does what is good, not even one.

God alone is gracious. God alone is merciful. God alone has perfect compassion. You did not deserve for God to look your way. But he did. He didn't saw you were a pretty good person in needing of a God to get you to that next level so you can go on living your best life. NO!

He foreknew you. He foreknew just how far you were from him.

><sup>16</sup> So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy.

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly giving

>John 1:11–13 (CSB) He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

>Ephesians 1:3–6 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.

>Ephesians 2:1–5 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!

Well, that is just Paul who talks about that. He doesn't really mean predestined. Except:

>John 15:16-17 (CSB) You did not choose me, but I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you. “This is what I command you: Love one another.

>1 John 4:9-10 (CSB) God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

We can do this all day.

## Our God

>Romans 9:17–18 (CSB) For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly holy

><sup>19</sup> You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?” 

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly sovereign

><sup>20-21</sup> On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? 

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly Creator

><sup>22</sup> And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 

### New Daily Mercies: God is perfectly God

## The Gospel

><sup>23</sup> And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory—
