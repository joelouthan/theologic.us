## The Text

<sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. <sup>17</sup> For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.
