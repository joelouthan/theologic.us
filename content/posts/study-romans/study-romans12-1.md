## The Text

>Romans 12:1 (CSB) Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship. 

## The Introduction

We have spent the the first eleven chapters of Romans extolling and magnifying and praising our great God and gone to the greatest details--within our finite wisdom and understanding--on how Christ has saved his people from their sins.

Romans 1-11, with the utmost authority, primacy and beginning of what I would call: a systematic theology. Romans is essentially an exposition on the Old Testament and the life, ministry, words, death, burial resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord. You want to know why those of who love theology love the book of Romans. Because Paul goes into the greatest detail on the power of the gospel.

The gospel is the power of God in salvation for those who believe. It is the only thing that saves us. Nothing else by God--not our minds, hearts, works, his laws, his provision, his creation--can save us. Just this gospel which is Jesus Christ and him crucified. What Paul does in Romans is being able to supernaturally describe this power. It is simply amazing. And for the people of God, it takes our breath away in awe and gives us breath to worship and sing and praise his holy name.

We have done great work in dissecting the law from the God using the book of Romans. Paul has gone to great lengths to distinguish the law of God from the gospel of God.

In summation, the law cannot save. It was never designed to saved.

>Romans 8:3–4 (CSB) For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

Not only that, you and I have already broken the law. When we have broken one law, we have broken it all.

>James 2:10 (CSB) For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.

And it is not that we keep breaking the law of God since it does not save us. No!

>Romans 6:1-2 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?

Why am I belaboring the point? For the rest of our time in Romans, God is going to lay out a series of commands for you and me. Romans is not to be bifurcated. It is not to be cut into two--focus on one and ignore the other. Romans 12-16 is in context for Romans 1-11 and because we interpret Scripture using Scripture (*sola Scriptura*), Romans must remain in context of the Bible.

John Calvin in his Institutes, Book 2, Chapter 7, he lays out three uses of the law that I find very helpful when reading the command of God.

### Three Uses of the Law

- **Mirror of ourselves** - when we read the law of God in the Bible, we examine ourselves and see that we are found wanting

>Romans 3:23 (CSB) For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;

The law of God is the holy standard of requirements that you and I must achieve perfectly with every second of our lives in order to be with God. But that is just it, God demands perfection and we have fallen way short of that--think of it as a infinite gap.

Here's where it really gets nuts: there are some unbelievers and believers think that they can still do enough works and somehow bridge that infinite gap. Here's a short math lesson: infinite gap minus one is still infinity. In other words, we are infinity distance from the glory of God. Do you honestly think that one of your or a million of your "good" works is going to close that gap?

That is what the Catholics believe. That is what the Muslims believe. That is what the Mormons believe. That is what most of the world believes. They believe and that they hope that God grades on a curve. "I might be bad but I am not as bad of Hitler." But all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The glory of God is infinite and you and I have fallen short of that.

- **Civil law to restrain pure evil** - difference between Total and Utter Depravity--we are not as evil as we could be

It could be way worse. See Genesis 5 and 6. See the Dark Ages from 500AD to 1500AD. See our world today. The law of God--whether carved on stone tablets for the Jews or written on the conscience of Gentiles' hearts, keeps us from fully going utter depravity--so wicked and evil that we could not be saved.

One more use of the law:

- **Good works that loves others and pleases God** - it is not that God needs anything from us but our neighbors do:

>Matthew 22:37-40 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. 38 This is the greatest and most important command. 39 The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. 40 All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”

>Ephesians 2:10 (CSB) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

We have the law as a way of living a righteous life unto God. We have Christ. The Father has given us his heart and the Spirit. Now we get to obey the laws of God because of Christ's perfect obedience to the law. 

The law does not save anyone but condemns everyone.

>Romans 3:20 (CSB) For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law

Christ came into the world not to condemn but to save the world through him.

>John 3:16-17 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

The writers of the Bible did not come to give more law but to give the great gospel of God--since the Genesis 3:15.

Paul was not eager to preach more law but rather the gospel:

>Romans 1:15 (CSB) So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

Let us sum up Romans this way:

- Romans 1-3: Here's us compared to the law
- Romans 4-7: There is nothing you can do
- Romans 8-11: Christ does it all
- Romans 11:33-36: Praise be to God!

Now for the rest of Romans:

- Romans 12-16: Go and love your neighbor

There is no gospel from here on out--just the law of loving your neighbor as yourself. Paul wrote to the church in Rome not as unbelievers. He knows that they are they are in Christ. For:

>Romans 1:5–7 (CSB) Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, including you who are also called by Jesus Christ. To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

He wrote to the church and the elders would have preached this letter to the congregation because they are sheep of the Good Shepherds. We do not entertain goats but feed, care, and love the lambs. (John 21:15-19)

Paul is giving the law to the followers of Christ so that they can live righteously *because* they belong to God.

It is never the opposite--we do not and cannot obey God to then belong to God.

## Our God

><sup>1</sup> Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship.

### Worship God

If the gospel is the power of God in salvation ( Romans 1:16), if his righteousness is revealed to us from faith to faith (17), we once suppressed the truth of God (18-25), we were once counted among the wicked? Therefore, worship God.

If the law was written upon our hearts (2:15), and the law was given to the Jews (12-14), and our disobedience was building up the just wrath of God upon us (5-10) even though God is slow to anger and his kindness was meant for our repentance (4)? Therefore, worship God.

If we were all not righteous (3:10-12) and all have fallens short of his glory (23) but God has given the righteousness of Christ to all of those who believe in his Son? Therefore, worship God.

If we cannot possibly pay back God nor put God in debt because our good works are only done in self-righteousness and therefore filthy rags in his sight (Romans 4)? Therefore, worship God.

If, because of Christ alone, we have been justified by faith, at peace with the Almighty God (5:1), access to the Almighty God, stand in the grace of God, get to boast in the hope of the glory of God (2), no matter what the world, Satan, and sin might come our way (3), be built up to look like Christ (4), and we shall never be disappointed in this hope because God's sweetest love has been poured out in our hearts in the Holy Spirit that God has given each one of us? Therefore, worship God.

We are helpless in our sin and we are ungodly! But God loved us so much that while we were yet sinner, Christ died for us! (Romans 5:6-8) Therefore, worship God!

While yet we were enemies towards God, Christ with his own life, saved us and reconciled us to God. (Romans 5:9-11) Therefore, worship God!

If we were born into sin because of our original father, Adam, and all our born-thoughts and actions are away from God and not towards God and yet, the Second Adam, came into this world not to condemn it but to save sinners, and his righteousness and eternal life to us? (Romans 5:12-19) Therefore, worship God!

If the law came in only to perfectly expose our infinite distance from God and increased and highlight the sin in our lives, therefore, worship God!

But if the grace of God through Jesus Christ multiplied exponentially over our sin, therefore, worship God!

Do we get to sin more? No! Sin has been put to death because Christ has died for our sins as sinners! We are dead to sin and alive to God! Death has died and Christ is alive! We are divorced from death and in union with Christ, therefore, worship Christ!

>>Let us muse upon the fact that Jesus was conducted without the gates of the city. It was the common place of death. That little rising ground, which perhaps was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, from its somewhat resembling the crown of a man's skull, was the common place of execution. It was one of Death's castles; here he stored his gloomiest trophies; he was the grim lord of that stronghold. Our great hero, the destroyer of Death, bearded the lion in his den, slew the monster in his own castle, and dragged the dragon captive from his own den. Methinks Death thought it a splendid triumph when he saw the Master impaled and bleeding in the dominions of destruction; little did he know that the grave was to be rifled, and himself destroyed, by that crucified Son of man.
>>
>>Charles Spurgeon. The Procession of Sorrow. [Sermon 497](https://archive.spurgeon.org/sermons/0497.php). March 1, 1863.

And we live this life unto Christ and residual sin from within our sick yet recovering hearts still surfaces and takes actions, there is no despair. For Christ Almighty saves our wretched self from our bodies of death.

Now we are free to obey God and walk in newness with him! Therefore, worship God!

## The Gospel

There is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus! Therefore, worship God!

>Oh close and blessed union! Justified by God, accepted in Christ, condemnation there cannot be. I stand in the Divine presence as Joshua stood before the Lord, or as the woman stood before the Savior, charged, accused, guilty; but I am in the presence of him who, though now he sits upon the throne as my Judge, once hung upon the cross as my Savior. And, investing me with his own spotless robe, he proceeds to pronounce the sentence- "NO CONDEMNATION!"
>
>"These things write I unto you that your joy may be full."
>
>Octavius Winslow. No Condemnation in Christ Jesus. 191.

Because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. Therefore, worship God!

For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. Therefore, worship God!

For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit. Therefore, worship God!

Now the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace. Therefore, worship God!

The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God’s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so. Therefore, worship God!

Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. Therefore, worship God!

You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him. Therefore, worship God!

Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. Therefore, worship God!

And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you. Therefore, worship God!

So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh, because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Therefore, worship God!

For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. Therefore, worship God!

For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” Therefore, worship God!

The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. Therefore, worship God!

For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. Therefore, worship God!

For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed. Therefore, worship God!

For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children. Therefore, worship God!

For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now. Therefore, worship God!

Not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. Therefore, worship God!

Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Therefore, worship God!

Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience. Therefore, worship God!

In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. Therefore, worship God!

And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. Therefore, worship God!

We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. Therefore, worship God!

For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. Therefore, worship God!

And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified. Therefore, worship God!

What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? Therefore, worship God!

He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything? Therefore, worship God!

Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. Therefore, worship God!

Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Therefore, worship God!

Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? Therefore, worship God!

As it is written: Because of you we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

>>"Through him that loved us." Here is the great secret of our victory, the source of our triumph. Behold the mystery explained, how a weak, timid believer, often running from his own shadow, is yet "more than a conqueror" over his many and mighty foes. 
>>
>>To Christ who loved him, who gave himself for him, who died in his stead, and lives to intercede on his behalf, the glory of the triumph is ascribed. And this is the song he chants, "Thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." 
>>
>>Through the conquest which he himself obtained, through the grace which he imparts, through the strength which he inspires, through the intercession which he presents, in all our "tribulation, and distress, and persecution, and famine, and nakedness, and peril, and sword" we are "more than conquerors." Accounted though we are as "sheep for the slaughter," yet our Great Shepherd, Himself slain for the sheep, guides his flock, and has declared that no one shall pluck them out of his hand. 
>>
>>We are more than conquerors through his grace who loved us in the very circumstances that threaten to overwhelm. Fear not, then, the darkest cloud, nor the proudest waves, nor the deepest needs- in these very things you shall, through Christ, prove triumphant. Nor shrink from the battle with the "last enemy." Death received a death-wound when Christ died. You face a conquered foe. He stands at your side a crownless king, and waving a broken scepter. Your death shall be another victory over the believer's last foe. Planting your foot of faith upon his prostrate neck, you shall spring into glory, more than a conqueror, through him that loved you. Thus passing to glory in triumph, you shall go to swell the ranks of the "noble army of martyrs"- those Christian heroes of whom it is recorded, "THEY OVERCAME HIM BY THE BLOOD Of THE LAMB."
>>
>>Octavius Winslow. No Condemnation in Christ Jesus. 229.

Death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

>>The gulf between the unbeliever and the ones with the smallest faith is abysmally infinite. However, there is no gap between the ones with the smallest faith and the arms and the heart of the loving Savior.
>>
>>Charles Spurgeon

I have one thing to tell you on this day: Worship God!

## Our Response

God will stop at nothing to rescue his people from their sins! Therefore, worship God!

God saves based not anything big nor small thing we have done. In fact, he didn't even wait for us to be born the first time so that he could born us again the second time! (Romans 9:11-15) He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, over 2000 years ago so you would be saved today. I tell you: worship God!

God not only is not prohibited by any forces--not even kings nor pharaohs nor angels nor demons not even our sin--to give compassion on whom he gives compassion and mercy on whom he gives mercy. I tell you: worship God!

For the wicked, he hardens the hearts of the wicked by proclaiming that we are not gods and he alone is God! I implore you: worship God!

And out of everyone, he saves his people--completely, entirely, perfectly, definitely. (16-33) I repeat: worship God!

And for us who were once not the people of God, we have been esteemed with the forever title: the people of God. What can I tell you? Worship God!

And for us who were bitter enemies of God, we are now called Beloved. WORSHIP GOD!

And if you have ever been told you are not of God in God by God for God even though God saves his children all the way home to him. Then the fools who would get you to cast doubt on the perfect saving work of the Almighty God, they stand corrected. I read in Romans 9:26, in this place we rightfully called: **sons of the living God!**

Why are you not worshiping God? Worship him!

Christ is the end of the law of righteousness for his people because he alone has perfectly obeyed the law of God with joy and gladness. We are not under condemnation of the law but under the joy of Christ.

Worship God, you blessed saints!

Christ has descended from on high to be born of a little infant into our world to live the life we could not have lived to die the death we should have die to descend into the depths of hell to snatch the keys of Death and Hades to resurrect from the grace that is impossible for man to do to make the path of life to God and sit at his right hand where there is only fullness of joy and pleasures and bliss forevermore.

Look at God and worship him!

The good news of God is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart. This is the message of faith because the Triune God has made his home in you. I tell you, worship God, church!

By the sheer power of the Holy Spirit, we proclaim and herald from the four corners of the earth that Jesus Christ is Lord! (1 Corinthians 12:1-3, Romans 10:8)

And we believe that Jesus Christ, Son of God, who is God, has risen again from the dead on the first Easter Sunday! WE ARE SAVED TO GOD BY GOD FOR GOD FOREVER!

Beloved, we worship God!

We believe and confess that there is no other name by which we are saved. We testify this absolute truth because not that we did anything good but because God alone is good! (Romans 10:10)

If there is no condemnation and no separation from God, thn blessed child, God will never shame you. 

Feel free to worship our great King!

Call upon the name of the Lord. Be saved by God! Worship his Majesty!

>>Majesty, worship His Majesty.  
>>Unto Jesus be all glory, honor and praise!  
>>Majesty, Kingdom Authority,  
>>Flow from His throne, unto His own  
>>His anthem raise!  
>>  
>>So exalt, lift up on high the Name of Jesus!  
>>Magnify, come glorify, Christ Jesus the King.  
>>Majesty, worship His Majesty;  
>>Jesus who died, now glorified, King of all kings! [^hayford]

[^hayford]: Jack Hayford. Majesty.

If you have heard the preaching of the gospel, the feebleness and weakness of the preacher who preached it, yet in the insurmountable and unstoppable power of God that is his gospel, you believe?

What can you do but sing His praises!

Count yourself, dear saint, among the chosen and remnant of the Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth. Therefore, taste and see that the Lord is good. Worship him!

God alone has opened our eyes. renewed our minds, quickened our tongues, restores our ears, swapped our dead hearts for his, and indwelling of the Spirit. We get to worship God right now!

God has made us a part of the greatest plan of redemption. We have sin much but God is mightier. We have dug a grave that reaches all the way to hell but Christ is deeper still! [^tenboom]

[^tenboom]: "No pit is so deep that He is not deeper still; with Jesus even in our darkest moments, the best remains and the very best is yet to be." Corrie Ten Boom.

Adopted children of God, worship His holy name!

>>He is exalted the King is exalted on High  
>>I will praise Him  
>>He is exalted forever exalted  
>>And I will praise His name  
>>  
>>He is the Lord  
>>Forever His truth shall reign  
>>Heaven and Earth  
>>Rejoice in His holy name  
>>He is exalted the King is exalted on high [^paris]

[^paris]: Twila Paris. He is Exalted.

Our Deliverer have comes from Zion! He has separated our godlessness away from the sons of Abraham! God has fulfilled his promise that he has taken away all of our sins.

That is promise his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.

Children of Abraham, we obtain mercy by God not because we were ever obedient but because of our disobedience. 

>Romans 11:33–36 (CSB)  
><sup>33</sup> Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways! 

><sup>34</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? 

><sup>35</sup> And who has ever given to God, that he should be repaid? 

><sup>36</sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.

### Worship God because he has done it all

>Romans 12:1 (CSB) Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship.

So what then can we say?  
So what then can we do?

Who is like our God and who can compare to him! He alone is holy and good!

So from the bottom of our hearts,  
We thank you, God, for giving me strength.

Thank you, our Father God.  
Thank you, our Christ Jesus.  
Thank you, our Holy Spirit.  

You judged us faithful.  
You appointed us to Your service.  
Despite our dishonoring and blaspheming,  
Your holy name,  
despite our persecution and hatred  
those who love you,  
despite our perverted and violent opposition  
towards you,  

Still  
We only received mercy  
because We was lost  
We were lame  
We were deaf  
We were blind  
We were stupid  
We were ignorant  
We were evil  
We were dead  
and We were not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender  
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for us  
overwhelmingly  
undeservedly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,  
for You,  
through You,  
our Christ Jesus our Lord our Savior.  

These words  
out of our hearts  
are true  
and with all of our hope and dreams  
and desires and wishes  
that our words would be sweet to your ears.  

We know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue us, your people  
to pull us out of despair  
to give us, your people, life  
to save us from our sins  
to bring us to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And we lead this group.  
We were the foremost of evil   
We were the chief of sinners   
We were the victor of sin  
We were the champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  

Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
our Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display  

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those whom You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  

This is why we will sing  
to our God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
our Triune  
our Father  
our Son  
our Holy Spirit  
our immortal  
our invisible  
our Only One  
our Creator  
our Sustainer  
our Merciful  
our Peace  
our Grace  
our Faith  
our Messiah  
our Immanuel, God with Us  
our Blessed  
our Living Word  
our Christ  
our Son of God  
our Fellow Heir  
our Second Adam  
our Kinsman Redeemer  
our Beginning  
our Means  
our End  
our Majesty  
our Truth  
our Way  
our Life  
our Wisdom  
our Teacher  
our Rescuer  
our Promise  
our Calling  
our Fulfillment  
our Abundance  
our Host

our Lion of Judah  
our Worthy Lamb who was slain  
our King of all kings  
our Lord of all lords  
our Commander  
our Ruler above all  
our Name above all Names  
our Wonderful Counselor  
our Mighty God  
our Everlasting Father  
our Prince of Peace  

our Holiness  
our Righteousness  
our Justice  
our Faithfulness  
our Mercy  
our Grace  
our Friend  
our Confidence  
our Pastor

our Redeemer  
our Rock  
our Salvation  
our All in all  
our Exalted

our Song  
our Love  

our Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
our Father, our Father, our Abba, our heart  
our Holy Spirit, our comfort, our peace, our gift, our breath.  

So we will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,
magnify,  
lift up,   
and love  
You alone.  

We pray this desperately and joyfully,  
in the beautiful,  
sweet,  
precious,  
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  

His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

No pen, no words, no images can express to you the loveliness of our only, only Lord Jesus Christ. [^rutherford]

[^rutherford]: Samuel Rutherford

But with every bit of our soul,  
body,  
strength,  
mind,  
heart,  
  will praise and bless your holy name
forever

Amen
