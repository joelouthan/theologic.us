## The Text

>Romans 10:1–13 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation. 

><sup>2</sup> I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 

><sup>3</sup> Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness. 

><sup>4</sup> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, 

><sup>5</sup> since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them. 

><sup>6</sup> But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, “Who will go up to heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down 

><sup>7</sup> or, “Who will go down into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead. 

><sup>8</sup> On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim: 

><sup>9</sup> If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 

><sup>10</sup> One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. 

><sup>11</sup> For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame, 

><sup>12</sup> since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him. 

><sup>13</sup> For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
