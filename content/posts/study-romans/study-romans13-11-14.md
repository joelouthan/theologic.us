## The Text

>Romans 13:11â€“14 (CSB)  
><sup>11</sup> Besides this, since you know the time, it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep, because now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. 

><sup>12</sup> The night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 

><sup>13</sup> Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. 

><sup>14</sup> But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.
