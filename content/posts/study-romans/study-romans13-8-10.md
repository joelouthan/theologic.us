## The Introduction

## Our God

><sup>8</sup> Do not owe anyone anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. 

### Love One Another: This is like loving God

>Matthew 22:34–40 (CSB) When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together. And one of them, an expert in the law, asked a question to test him: “Teacher, which command in the law is the greatest?” He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”

><sup>9</sup> The commandments, Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up by this commandment: Love your neighbor as yourself. 

### Love One Another: Love is of God

>1 John 4:7–8 (CSB) Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

## Our Response

><sup>10</sup> Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.

### Love One Another: Loving Others is Obedience to God
