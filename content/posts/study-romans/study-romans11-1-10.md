## The Text

>Romans 11:1–10 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 

><sup>2</sup> God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he pleads with God against Israel? 

><sup>3</sup> Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life! 

><sup>4</sup> But what was God’s answer to him? I have left seven thousand for myself who have not bowed down to Baal. 

><sup>5</sup> In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace. 

><sup>6</sup> Now if by grace, then it is not by works; otherwise grace ceases to be grace. 

><sup>7</sup> What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened, 

><sup>8</sup> as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that cannot see and ears that cannot hear, to this day. 

><sup>9</sup> And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution to them. 

><sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and their backs be bent continually.
