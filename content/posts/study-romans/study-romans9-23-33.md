**>Lamentations 3:22–23 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness!**

## The Text

>Romans 9:23–33 (CSB)  
><sup>23</sup> And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory—

><sup>24</sup> on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 

><sup>25</sup> As it also says in Hosea, I will call Not my People, My People, and she who is Unloved, Beloved. 

><sup>26</sup> And it will be in the place where they were told, you are not my people, there they will be called sons of the living God. 

><sup>27</sup> But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, Though the number of Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved; 

><sup>28</sup> since the Lord will execute his sentence completely and decisively on the earth. 

><sup>29</sup> And just as Isaiah predicted: If the Lord of Hosts had not left us offspring, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah. 

><sup>30</sup> What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness—namely the righteousness that comes from faith. 

><sup>31</sup> But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not achieved the righteousness of the law. 

><sup>32</sup> Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 

><sup>33</sup> As it is written, Look, I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over and a rock to trip over, and the one who believes on him will not be put to shame.
