## The Text

<sup>13</sup> Now I don’t want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now) in order that I might have a fruitful ministry among you, just as I have had among the rest of the Gentiles. <sup>14</sup> I am obligated both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and the foolish. <sup>15</sup> So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
