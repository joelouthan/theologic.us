## The Text

<sup>8</sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world. <sup>9</sup> God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in telling the good news about his Son—that I constantly mention you, <sup>10</sup> always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you. <sup>11</sup> For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, <sup>12</sup> that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.
