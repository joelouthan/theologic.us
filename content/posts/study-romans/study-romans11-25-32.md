## The Text

>Romans 11:25-32 (CSB)  
><sup>25</sup> I don’t want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you will not be conceited: A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. 

><sup>26</sup> And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. 

><sup>27</sup> And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. 

><sup>28</sup> Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of the patriarchs, 

><sup>29</sup> since God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable. 

><sup>30</sup> As you once disobeyed God but now have received mercy through their disobedience, 

><sup>31</sup> so they too have now disobeyed, resulting in mercy to you, so that they also may now receive mercy. 

><sup>32</sup> For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may have mercy on all.
