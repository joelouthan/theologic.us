Your love is tremendous. I love the way you adore others. I love that you are always thoughtful of me. Every time you say goodbye, you always give me a hug. For that love, thank you.

After you go off to sleep, your mom and I stay up and talk about our children—all of the hopes and dreams that we have for you kids. I love it when we get to talk about you because I love bragging on you. I love getting to witness how much you have grown physically as well as mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. In fact, your own growth has challenged my growth as well.

For all of that and so much more, I praise and thank God for you.

When I see you, I see incredible resilience. When I see you, I see strength and power. Seeing you filled with the love and strength of the Almighty God, I can fathom how the gates of hell shall not prevail against His beautiful Bride.

When I hear you, I sense that you are a leader. You are leader who able to pull her people through the thick and thin. You call for attention for those around you. You are asking that people keep their eyes on you so that they understand what you are saying. You will inspire people to do great and marvelous things.

When I am near you, I know that you would not hesitate to lay your life down for those whom you love. I see you are incredible mindful of loved ones, and continue to try to give to others so that they know what it means to be loved and to have joy. For all of your toughness, your love is super tender, sweet, kind and gentle.

These words may be too much for you to understand them now.  But the words I write right now are the things I see in your life and I write them down so that your joy may be full in Him.

Always remember, I am speaking what truths I see in your life. But never think for one moment that you _always_ have to be strong. Even you cannot continuously bear that impossible weight of glory. However, God, who is the Almighty, can and will bear the heaviest of your burdens. When you are weak, he will be your strength. Trust in Him alone and you will never know strength like His strength. In other words, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his infinite might.

You are an amazing little girl. And I get a front row seat just to see you grow up to be an amazing, beautiful woman of God. It is my joy, honor, privilege, and blessing to know you, to love you, and to get to help grow you, all for the glory of His great name.

I love you, little girl. I love you, my strongest Grace. Forever and always.

&nbsp;

From your giant step-daddy,

Jo-Jo
