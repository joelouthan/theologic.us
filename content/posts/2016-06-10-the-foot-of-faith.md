> &#8220;Through him that loved us.&#8221; Here is the great secret of our victory, the source of our triumph. Behold the mystery explained, how a weak, timid believer, often running from his own shadow, is yet &#8220;more than a conqueror&#8221; over his many and mighty foes. To Christ who loved him, who gave himself for him, who died in his stead, and lives to intercede on his behalf, the glory of the triumph is ascribed. And this is the song he chants, &#8220;Thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jews Christ.&#8221; Through the conquest which he himself obtained, through the grace which he imparts, through the strength which he inspires, through the intercession which he presents, in all our &#8220;tribulation, and distress, and persecution, and famine, and nakedness, and peril, and sword &#8221; we are &#8220;more than conquerors.&#8221; Accounted though we are as &#8220;sheep for the slaughter,&#8221; yet our Great Shepherd, Himself slain for the sheep, guides his flock, and has declared that no one shall pluck them out of his hand. We are more than conquerors through his grace who loved us in the very circumstances that threaten to overwhelm. Fear not, then, the darkest cloud, nor the proudest waves, nor the deepest needs—in these very things you shall, through Christ, prove triumphant. Nor shrink from the battle with the &#8220;last enemy.&#8221; Death received a death-wound when Christ died. You face a conquered foe. He stands at your side a crownless king, and waving a broken scepter. Your death shall be another victory over the believer&#8217;s last foe. Planting your foot of faith upon his prostrate neck, you shall spring into glory, more than a conqueror, through him that loved you. Thus passing to glory in triumph, you shall go to swell the ranks of the &#8220;noble army of martyrs&#8221;—those Christian heroes of whom it is recorded, &#8220;THEY OVERCAME HIM BY THE BLOOD Of THE LAMB.&#8221;
