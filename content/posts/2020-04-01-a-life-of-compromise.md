**How to Be Released and Then Imprisoned**

And I would say that the real hell really didn't start with came next after being on the run: my parents filing divorce with the Dallas County Family Courts. While I will not say the divorce trial was the beginning of the real hell, what was ruled in that trial certainly excavated a deep enough chasm to contain said hell. While the court system was somewhat *wise* in not immediately granting my father immediate custody, their deep seeded racist tendencies really kicked into high gear.  And by 'their', I mean the judge, my dad, his attorneys, my grandma, etc.. You see, they could not give custody of the boys to the boys' mother because, one, she was a foreigner who, God forbid, decided to make English her second language and that, two, she would take her half-Korean, half-White baby boys back to the third world slum ghettos known as South Korea.

Exhibit A of South Korea circa 1980, your honor.

Oh, the humanity!

Two boys with two parents that neither could seen to be fit as caretakers. The resolution was for the boys to stay in 'managerial custody' with the father's mother.

This would be Frances. Mim-maw to me and her grandchildren. Mims or Frank when texting back and forth with my brother.  A blessed saint who helped raised and blessed every single baby who were checked into the Sunday morning nursery from 1970s to her retirement in the mid-2000s.

And her reputation was well-deserved. She was a saint. She feared and loved God with all of her soul. She prayed for every single one of her degenerate kids and grandkids until the day she passed away. Yet, as I am painfully learning in raising three kids, parenting is difficult and we cannot parent perfectly.

When she had us in her custody, it was as close to heaven as I could ever imagine. (Let me be honest: my bar for life on earth thus far was set pretty low.) But she loved God and tried to raise all of her children to love God. And at least I got to catch glimpses.
