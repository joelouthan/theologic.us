<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My God,
</div>

In my finite perception, my circumstances would seem to say I am in despair. I feel that. I feel that onslaught. I feel that pressure.

Many would say, ”Ah, your God has failed. Your God is not good. Your God does not deliver. Your God does not save.”

They would be wrong on all accounts.

When I turn away from all of my oppressors and turn towards you, I see the loveliness of your face. It is because of your presence, my soul is now at rest.

Your Son took all of my affliction and wrath and absorbed all the violence that can ever be dealt to me. I will see no punishment from you. I will see no anger from you. I will see no rejection from you. You will not forsake me. You will not forget me.

Salvation belongs to you, O Lord, for you are the mighty one to save.

Be with me, Lord. I have no one else to turn to. You alone have the words to eternal life.

By Your Son&#8217;s beautiful name,

Amen

Ps 3:1-8; Ps 23:1-6; Eph 6:12; Ps 17:15; Rom 3:25; Heb 2:17; 1 John 4:10; Josh 1:5; Jonah 2:9; Zeph 3:17

**Series: **As a young believer, I have not had the chance to read all the way through the Bible. The Psalms and Proverbs will be the last books before I finish the Old Testament in Ezekiel, Daniel, then Isaiah. As I read through the Psalms, I was struck by the very _personal and intimate nature_ of the Psalms despite the deep theological, doctrinal, and Christocentric focus of the written songs themselves.  Using the Psalms as a mere template and an outline, how I would I respond? So doing just that, I began writing out prayers based on each of the Psalms.
