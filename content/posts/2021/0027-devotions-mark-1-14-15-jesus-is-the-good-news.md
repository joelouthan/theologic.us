## The Text

>Mark 1:14-15 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

## The Devotion

When you read the other gospels, such as Matthew, you will get more of John the Baptist preaching, "Repent for the kingdom of God is near."

Yet, when John was done with paving the way for Christ, and then Christ started ministering--only with the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

Because Christ has arrived, the kingdom of God has arrived. In other words, when Christ started his ministry, that was the start of the kingdom of God.

>Matthew 16:13-20 (CSB) When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”
>
>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
>
>“But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am?”
>
>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
>
>Jesus responded, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.” Then he gave the disciples orders to tell no one that he was the Messiah.

Christ began the kingdom of God and Christ continues to build his kingdom. And he does so within his church.

There is no separation from his kingdom and his church.

>Ephesians 3:8-13 (CSB) This grace was given to me—the least of all the saints—to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things. This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens. This is according to his eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him we have boldness and confident access through faith in him. So, then, I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Is the kingdom of God right here, right now?

What is the kingdom of God? Is it like a country like the United States—does it have a location? Does it include all of the earth, all of heaven and all of outer space?

Does it have a leader?

Who lives in the kingdom of God?

2. What does it mean to repent?

What does it mean to turn away from sin and turn towards God?

What does it mean to trust in God?

3. What is the gospel? Tell me some of the things you think the gospel of God is.
