## The Introduction

## The Text

>1 Timothy 3:14-16 (CSB) I write these things to you, hoping to come to you soon. But if I should be delayed, I have written so that you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. And most certainly, the mystery of godliness is great:
>
>He was manifested in the flesh,  
>vindicated in the Spirit,  
>seen by angels,  
>preached among the nations,  
>believed on in the world,  
>taken up in glory.

## The Meditation

We see how the Elders and Deacons are qualified to oversee God's churches. We have the rest of Scripture to show us what are their duties--mostly laid out in places like 1 Timothy 3, Titus 1, Ephesians 4 all through the heart of God revealed in John 21.

So what of the people of God? What about the people in the pews who have put their faith and hope in Jesus? Just like the Elders and the Deacons of the church, the people of the church are to behold the mystery of God.

Elders must have the ability to teach the mysteries of God (1 Timothy 3:2) and even the Deacons are to hold "the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience" (1 Timothy 3:9). Are the people of God who have been redeemed and bought for by the blood of the Lamb should do any less?

Think on these things:

>He was manifested in the flesh,  
>vindicated in the Spirit,  
>seen by angels,  
>preached among the nations,  
>believed on in the world,  
>taken up in glory.

The manifestation of God in the flesh; his vindication in the Spirit, witnessed by the all rulers and authorities in heavenly places; preached to the ends of the earth; his people being trust and believe in him by power of the Spirit; all the while Christ intercedes for the saints at the right hand of the Father--these are not mere facts so you can pass some theological pop quiz to allow you entrance into heaven. You and I are to believe on this and we will have eternal life with God.

If this mystery has changed our lives, what are we to do with it?

## The Gospel

In other words, what is the good news in all of this and how do we live by it?

### God has been fully revealed to all of mankind in His Son, Jesus Christ

>Colossians 1:24-29 (CSB) Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I am completing in my flesh what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for his body, that is, the church. I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. God wanted to make known among the Gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ. I labor for this, striving with his strength that works powerfully in me.

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

### God has made his will truly and fully known by giving us his Son, Jesus Christ

>Ephesians 1:7-10 (CSB) In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding. He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ as a plan for the right time—to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

### God has bought and reckoned us to him by the way of His Son, Jesus Christ, who is the Bridegroom to the Bride that is the Church

>Ephesians 5:25-32 (CSB) Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word. He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless. In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, since we are members of his body. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church.

>Ephesians 3:1-13 (CSB) For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— assuming you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that he gave me for you. The mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have briefly written above. By reading this you are able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. This was not made known to people in other generations as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and partners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of his power.
>
>This grace was given to me—the least of all the saints—to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things. This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens. This is according to his eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him we have boldness and confident access through faith in him. So, then, I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory.

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

### Because you believe and trust in Him, and you belong to God, you are called to proclaim this good news to every one

>Mark 16:15-16 (CSB) Then he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

## The Prayer

Amen.
