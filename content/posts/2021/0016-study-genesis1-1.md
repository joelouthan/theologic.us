## The Introduction

## The Text

>John 1:1-2 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.

## The Support

You would think that when you about to study Genesis, that the first study you are about to do is something about Creation. Almost. But to be honest, we are not just there yet.

Before the heavens and the earth were formed, before the mountains took shape and the oceans were filled, before time and space were created, from everlasting to everlasting there is one God.

What was God doing before he created the heavens and the earth? In other words, what was God doing before Genesis 1:1?

**Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?**

## God

### Before we even came about, God had everything he needed--he was not in need of anything more

>John 10:25-30 (CSB) “I did tell you and you don’t believe,” Jesus answered them. “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify about me. But you don’t believe because you are not of my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

>John 17:1-5 (CSB) Jesus spoke these things, looked up to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, since you gave him authority over all people, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him. This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent —Jesus Christ. I have glorified you on the earth by completing the work you gave me to do. Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with that glory I had with you before the world existed.

To say "relationship" and "community" to describe the Triune God does not do it justice. It feels incomplete--I think mostly so because here on earth, we have never experienced perfect relationships and community with one another. Those concepts and words are marred, tainted and infected with sin and wickedness.

But not so with God.

The best way I have ever heard this explained was my old professor, Dr. Sinclair Ferguson, who loosely quoting Augustine, explained it this way:

"You, me and one other person can be in the same room but we have three minds, wills, and spirits, along with three physical bodies. While the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit can be in the same room, three distinct and different people but share one mind, one heart, one will, and one spirit."

Look how Christ explained it:

>Father, glorify me in your presence with that glory I had with you before the world existed.

And

>I and the Father are one.

That is an insane thought. Never mind the fact that first century Jews saw that statement as utter blasphemous. But any mind from any time period would take that statement as nuts and insane. I am one with God? Looney.

But just because we can't wrap our minds around the concept of being one, doesn't mean it is not for real.

We will get there by the grace of God alone. Until then, the Father will conform us to the image of his Son so that he might be the firstborn among his siblings. (Romans 8:29)

### Before time and space were thought of, God had already set his affection upon his people

>Psalms 90:1-2 (CSB)
>Lord, you have been our refuge
>in every generation.
>Before the mountains were born,
>before you gave birth to the earth and the world,
>from eternity to eternity, you are God.

>Romans 8:28-30 (CSB) We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

>Ephesians 1:3-6 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.

>Ephesians 2:1-5 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!

>Romans 5:6-8 (CSB) For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

I have heard so many weird explanations from well-intended Christians try to do their best to explain away words like predestination and foreknew when it comes to God. We don't have a frame for knowing before existing. We don't have a mindset of loving before we were alive. But for the God was is from everlasting to everlasting, this is who he is and nothing more nor less.

There is one thought called Molinism that attempts to bridge the omniscience and omnipotence of God and the supposed free will of Mankind. Molinism explains it this way: "God sees throughout all of time and in every timeline and see where individuals would choose Him and makes that timeline happen." But there is a couple problems with that:

First, the Bible states that we were dead in our trespasses. So how does a dead person able to choose God unless there is something outside of that dead person to give them life? Have you ever met a dead person who brought himself back to life? Christ did so by the Holy Spirit. How can any one else do more than that? And in this, Romans 5:8 is such a comfort:

>Romans 5:6-8 (CSB) For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

The Bible rightly states that we were helpless and ungodly. But God proved his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Think about this: when did the crucifixion of Christ occurred? A little over two thousand years ago. When did you start sinning against God? Before or after that? Christ never looked down the corridors of time and saw that we were choosing God but rather, he looked down the corridors of time, saw that were running hard into sin and death. Titus 3 says it best:

>Titus 3:3 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.

Christ saw all of that and with great joy descended into death upon the cross so that we would live!

>Titus 3:4-7 (CSB) But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.

Second, the Scriptures never says "foresaw" as in "God looked into time and foresaw those who would choose him."  No, God foreknew his people.

Don't overthink it. God loved his people before time began.

God is eternal like that.

This is complete conjuncture because the Scriptures are not explicit and I certainly was not there. But I always thought that before anything, the Father and the Son were in perfection expressing their love for one another and then the conversation took a turn:

Father: I love you  
Son: I love you  
Father: I love you so much  
Son: I love you so much  
Father: I had a thought  
Son: Oh yea!  
Father: Do you know who I love so much?  
Son: Alex? What about Kim?  
Father: Yes. What about Dieter?  
Son: Oh snap... and how about Dwayne  
Father: and Lori  
Son: and Jessica  
Father: and Natsuko  
Son: and what about...  
Father: and what about...  
Son: *laughs*  
Father: *laughs*  
Son: You know what I am thinking  
Father: I had the same thought. *With tears in his eyes* But you know what is going to happen?  
Son: Yea, I know. *Tears welling up* But don't you worry, I will go get them.  
Father: This is hard and I will send you to save them all... but you are going to need all the help in the world.  
Son: I wouldn't do it with Him. Spirit, you ready?  
Spirit: *deeply exhales* Ready!  
Father: I love you.  
Son: I love you.  
Father: I love you so much.  
Son: I love you so much.  
Father: Here we go!  
Son: Let's do this!

>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

## The Gospel

God, who is love and is the only one who can properly define what love is, in his perfection from eternity past to the eternity future, always had those who believed and trust in his Son.

If you believe and trust his Son, then before Genesis 1:1 even happen, God affectionately, passionately, perfectly, definitely loved you and loved you before everything.

You now have eyes to see, ears to hear, mind to think, and a new heart with new desires. You have the same Spirit in you that raised Christ Jesus from the dead.

You are not just a physical body walking around merely existing. You are now fully and truly alive.

## Our Responsibility

What is ours to do?

Figure out who is the elect and not the elect? Nope! That mystery does not belong to us.

Break our theology and the English language trying to make two concepts of sovereignty and the freedom of the will of dead people and make them compatible? Nope. God makes it clear for what we are to know. We don't get to fully know God--our finite minds cannot possible comprehend him on that level. But because of the perfect life and perfect death of Christ our Lord, we get to *truly* know him.

What we get do: repent of our sins and put our trust in the Mighty One who saves.

## Pray
