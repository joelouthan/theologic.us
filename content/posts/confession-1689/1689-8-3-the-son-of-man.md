## The Text

>Daniel 7:9-14 (CSB)  
>“As I kept watching,  
>thrones were set in place,  
>and the Ancient of Days took his seat.  
>His clothing was white like snow,  
>and the hair of his head like whitest wool.  
>His throne was flaming fire;  
>its wheels were blazing fire.  
>A river of fire was flowing,  
>coming out from his presence.  
>Thousands upon thousands served him;  
>ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.  
>The court was convened,  
>and the books were opened.
>
>“I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time.
>
>I continued watching in the night visions,  
>and suddenly one like a son of man  
>was coming with the clouds of heaven.  
>He approached the Ancient of Days  
>and was escorted before him.  
>He was given dominion  
>and glory and a kingdom,  
>so that those of every people,  
>nation, and language  
>should serve him.  
>His dominion is an everlasting dominion  
>that will not pass away,  
>and his kingdom is one  
>that will not be destroyed.

## The Chapter

```text
The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine, in the person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure, having in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell, to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth, he might be throughly furnished to execute the office of mediator and surety; which office he took not upon himself, but was thereunto called by his Father; who also put all power and judgement in his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the same.
```

## The Confession

### The Lord Jesus, in His human nature thus united to the divine, in the person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure

>Psalm 45:7 (CSB) You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy more than your companions.

>Acts 10:38 (CSB) how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were under the tyranny of the devil, because God was with him.

>John 3:34 (CSB) For the one whom God sent speaks God’s words, since he gives the Spirit without measure.

### having in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge

>Colossians 2:3 (CSB) In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

### in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell

>Colossians 1:19 (CSB) For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,

### to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled

>Hebrews 7:26 (CSB) For this is the kind of high priest we need: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.

### and full of grace and truth

>John 1:14 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

### He might be throughly furnished to execute the office of mediator and surety

>Hebrews 7:22 (CSB) Because of this oath, Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.

### which office He took not upon himself, but was thereunto called by His Father

>Hebrews 5:5 (CSB) In the same way, Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but God who said to him, You are my Son; today I have become your Father,

### who also put all power and judgement in His hand, and gave Him commandment to execute the same

>John 5:22–27 (CSB) The Father, in fact, judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son, so that all people may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. “Truly I tell you, anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not come under judgment but has passed from death to life. “Truly I tell you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. And he has granted him the right to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man.

>Matthew 28:18 (CSB) Jesus came near and said to them, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

>Acts 2:36 (CSB) “Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
