## The Text

>Romans 8:20-21 (CSB) For the creation was subjected to futility — not willingly, but because of him who subjected it — in the hope that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.

## The Chapter

```text
When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin, and by his grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good; yet so as that by reason of his remaining corruptions, he doth not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil.
```

## The Confession

### When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin

>Colossians 1:13 (CSB) He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.

Your will, before the intervention of God in your life, was a free as a prisoner in their cell. You had freedom to roam the confines of your own sin.

God, because of the work of Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit, who alone has complete freedom of the will, frees you from your bondage to sin.

When Christ frees you, you are no longer in bondage to sin. You are free!

>John 8:36 (CSB) So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.

### and by His grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good

>Philippians 2:13 (CSB) For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose.

God, by His grace, enables you to will and to do that which is spiritually good. Remember, he gives you a new heart so now you have new desires. (Ezekiel 36:26; Psalm 37:4)  You have his Spirit and you are now lead by him. (Romans 8:14) God has saved you and has prepared good works for you to do. (Ephesians 2:10) Now, your neighbor needs these good works. Go love them as you would love your self. (Matthew 22:39)

### yet so as that by reason of his remaining corruptions, he does not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good, but does also will that which is evil

>Romans 7:15–23 (CSB) For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate. Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good. So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me. For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it. For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do. Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one that does it, but it is the sin that lives in me. So I discover this law: When I want to do what is good, evil is present with me. For in my inner self I delight in God’s law, but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.

My Beloved, this is the life of the Christian. We still live in post-Genesis 3 and not yet-Revelation 22. We are still at war with sin. We will still sin. But don't you see, God has you because you are so precious to him. How do I know that? He was willing to give up his Son so that you would be with him forever.
