## The Text

>Hebrews 9:15 (CSB) Therefore, he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.

## The Chapter

```text
This office of mediator between God and man is proper only to Christ, who is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God; and may not be either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from him to any other.
```

## The Confession

>1 Timothy 2:5 (CSB) For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,

In recent times, from usually Christians, will balk at the audacity of the preached word. Here is what I mean. If the preacher dares to declare, "This is what the word of God says!", sometimes the listener will either retort, debate, reject or downright ignore.

And to be honest, I see their point. We have so many preachers and teachers who have mishandled the word of God, used the Scriptures for their own ill-gotten gains, and wrap up their gross sin by aptly declaring, "this is the word of God declares", and secretly hoping you don't read the word of God for yourself and you don't test every prophecy (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21).

What is true about false teachers now is always been true since Genesis 3. False shepherds, exactly like their father Satan, will not outright deny the Bible but in fact, twist it in order to deceive you. Unless these false preachers repent of their wickedness, they will burn in hell. And they, like their father Satan, will try to hurt as many of the the children of God along the way. They twist the words of God not unintentionally but intentionally in order to build their kingdoms of feces for their lives made of vapor.

>Jeremiah 23:1-4 (CSB) “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! ” This is the LORD’s declaration. “Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I am about to attend to you because of your evil acts” — this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous. I will raise up shepherds over them who will tend them. They will no longer be afraid or discouraged, nor will any be missing.” This is the LORD’s declaration.

In his time, Christ will replace those hired hands with under-shepherds he has raised up. Christ alone is the Good Shepherd.

What true in the Evangelical age of the church was certainly true in the pre-Reformation age of the church. The church in power at the time, the Roman Catholic Church, heretically and with grave error, that there was another meditator between man and God and that would be the be Pope.

That false teaching from false teacher in complete contradiction to the word of God.

>1 Timothy 2:5 (CSB) For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,

And if you try to use the argument for needing a mediator between Christ and mankind, I got some news for you. Christ is not only the Son of God who is God but also the Son of Man because he is fully man. We do not need another mediator between us and God because no man, born in flesh, was ever qualified to be the mediator between us and God other than Jesus Christ, who was always fully God and took on flesh in order to bridge the infinite gap between God and mankind.

There is no other name by which we are saved.
