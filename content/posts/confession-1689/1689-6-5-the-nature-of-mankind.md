## The Text

>2 Corinthians 5:21 (CSB) He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

## The Chapter

```text
The corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those that are regenerated; and although it be through Christ pardoned and mortified, yet both itself, and the first motions thereof, are truly and properly sin.
```

## The Confession

### The corruption of nature, during this life, does remain in those that are regenerated

>Romans 7:18 (CSB) For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it.

>Romans 7:23 (CSB) but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.

>Ecclesiastes 7:20 (CSB) There is certainly no one righteous on the earth who does good and never sins.

>1 John 1:8 (CSB) If we say, “We have no sin,” we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

The Reformer Martin Luther called this state of the saved believer: Simul Justus et Peccator. In other words, the people of God are both justified and sinner at the same time.

I cannot account for all of Christian history, but seemingly, especially in Evangelistic circles, the debate surrounding Romans 7:7-25. And the debate is attempting to answer this: TODO:

### and although it be through Christ pardoned and mortified, yet both itself, and the first motions thereof, are truly and properly sin

>Romans 7:23–25 (CSB) but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin.

>Galatians 5:17 (CSB) For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want.
