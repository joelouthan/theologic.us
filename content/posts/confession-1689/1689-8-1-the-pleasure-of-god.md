## The Text

>Psalm 16 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A Miktam of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you. 

><sup>2</sup> I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides you.” 

><sup>3</sup> As for the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones. All my delight is in them. 

><sup>4</sup> The sorrows of those who take another god for themselves will multiply; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, and I will not speak their names with my lips. 

><sup>5</sup> LORD, you are my portion and my cup of blessing; you hold my future. 

><sup>6</sup> The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 

><sup>7</sup> I will bless the LORD who counsels me— even at night when my thoughts trouble me. 

><sup>8</sup> I always let the LORD guide me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

><sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my whole being rejoices; my body also rests securely. 

><sup>10</sup> For you will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful one to see decay. 

><sup>11</sup> You reveal the path of life to me; in your presence is abundant joy; at your right hand are eternal pleasures.

## The Chapter

```text
It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, according to the covenant made between them both, to be the mediator between God and man; the prophet, priest, and king; head and saviour of the church, the heir of all things, and judge of the world; unto whom he did from all eternity give a people to be his seed and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.
```

## The Confession

### It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, according to the covenant made between them both, to be the mediator between God and man

>Isaiah 42:1 (CSB) “This is my servant; I strengthen him, this is my chosen one; I delight in him. I have put my Spirit on him; he will bring justice to the nations.

>1 Peter 1:19–20 (CSB) but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was revealed in these last times for you.

### the prophet

>Acts 3:22 (CSB) Moses said: The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you.

### priest

>Hebrews 5:5–6 (CSB) In the same way, Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but God who said to him, You are my Son; today I have become your Father, also says in another place, You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

### king

>Psalm 2:6 (CSB) “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.”

>Luke 1:33 (CSB) He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end.”

### head and savior of the church

>Ephesians 1:22–23 (CSB) And he subjected everything under his feet and appointed him as head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.

### the heir of all things

>Hebrews 1:2 (CSB) In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him.

### and judge of the world

>Acts 17:31 (CSB) because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed. He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”

### unto whom He did from all eternity give a people to be His seed and to be by Him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified

>Isaiah 53:10 (CSB) Yet the LORD was pleased to crush him severely. When you make him a guilt offering, he will see his seed, he will prolong his days, and by his hand, the LORD’s pleasure will be accomplished.

>John 17:6 (CSB) “I have revealed your name to the people you gave me from the world. They were yours, you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

>Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.
