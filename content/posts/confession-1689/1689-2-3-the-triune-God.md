## The Chapter

```text
In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word or Son, and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided: the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son; all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him.

## The Confession

### In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences

>1 John 5:7–10 (CSB) For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are in agreement. If we accept human testimony, God’s testimony is greater, because it is God’s testimony that he has given about his Son. The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony within himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony God has given about his Son.

I am in full appreciation of theologians in the past, that have crafted and wrote the *Westminster Confession of Faith* and the *Savoy Declaration*. The Baptists, with the 1st and 2nd London Confessions, only added a few clarifying words here and there but in every sense, blatantly plagiarize the WCF/Savoy. "If it aint broke, don't fix it" is an apropos saying from my childhood.

But another way to state this: the early church theologians have already done the heavy lifting in fine tuning and carefully crafting the right words in order to protect believers from heresy.

Here, a word that is not used often, subsistences. (This word is so less know that my writing application, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, is marking it as misspelled.) But even using words like *persons* or *persona* might pull a believer into tritheism or even monotheism.

The definition for *subsistence* is real being. God, not a figment of anyone's imagination, not a mode, not a mask, not a god with three different names who switches out these names, masks, personalities when the time is right. God is three real beings.

### the Father, the Word or Son, and Holy Spirit

>Matthew 28:19 (CSB) Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

And it was when Jesus Christ began his ministry on the earth that he massively unveils one of the greatest mysteries of the Old Testament, second only to how will God finally rescue his people. The answer to greatest mystery of the gospel of God in the OT is the Lord Jesus Christ. And with the revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ and the proclamation from his mouth, he reveals that God is three subsistences or three hypostases or three real beings: God the Father, God the Holy Spirit and himself, the Word, that is, God the Son.

Now think of the preaching ministry of Christ. God with us, taking on flesh, fully God and fully man makes the declaration to believers and non-believers alike:

>John 10:29-30 (CSB) My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

How do you think that the most religious of the day responded? Took it all in? Pondered the points? Consider the memorized Scriptures?

No! They responded in violence!

>John 10:33 (CSB) “We aren’t stoning you for a good work,” the Jews answered, “but for blasphemy, because you — being a man — make yourself God.”

Christ himself God and equal with the Father because why? Christ is God. In the same way, I am Joseph Louthan. I could state all the things that are used to identify myself according the world and to history and to philosophy: male, tall, son of Joseph and Sue, Technical Project Manager, writer, wife of Sarah, father of three kids, heterosexual.

But the only identity that actually matters is: am I in Christ or not in Christ. The fact is I am an adopted child of the living God. That is an absolute fact.

Christ stating his actual existence, his subsistence, his real being--that is an absolute fact.

So many people don't want to know or can't stand knowing. Don't be ignorant of the facts: we are saved by sovereign grace of the Father by the power of the Almighty Spirit through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God who is God.

### of one substance, power, and eternity

>2 Corinthians 13:13 (CSB) The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

However and whatever means you use to preach and teach the doctrine of the Trinity, you must not forget the attributes of God [^1689.2.1]

[^1689.2.1]: see [1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, Chapter 2.1 The Attributes of God](/posts/confession-1689/1689-2-1-the-attributes-of-god/)

We know that God is eternal:

>Psalm 90:2 (CSB) Before the mountains were born, before you gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, you are God.

>Revelation 22:12-13 (CSB) “Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me to repay each person according to his work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

And we know he is almighty:

>Genesis 17:1 (CSB) When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, “I am God Almighty. Live in my presence and be blameless.

>Revelation 4:8 (CSB) Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,  
>Holy, holy, holy,  
>Lord God, the Almighty,  
>who was, who is, and who is to come.

What about one substance?

>Deuteronomy 6:4 (CSB) “Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.

>John 10:29-30 (CSB) My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

### each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided

>Exodus 3:14 (CSB) God replied to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.”


>John 8:57-58 (CSB) The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham? ”Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.

I think the best way of describing this is loosely quoting Augustine:

>>With three people in a room, you have three minds, souls, hearts, spirits and wills. With the Triune God in the room, you still have three persons but you would only have one mind, one soul, one heart, one Spirit, and one will.

That description alone transcends God from us. God is so unlike us--that even when we are like God in that we love, give, serve, and create and we can do all of these things that reflects his image, what makes God apart from everything else in all of creation is the fact that God is three persons yet with one undivided essence.

The Doctrine of the Trinity is such a mystery. The moment we try to demystify it is the moment we are declaring outright *historical* heresy.  [^heresy]

[^heresy]: For the record, there are no new heresy. All heresies are historical. In other words, the church before us have already done the heavy lifting of hearing the false teaching, examining the Scriptures by the power of the Spirit, and put that heresy to death. There are no new errors and heresies. If you hear a false teacher or a Christian who says something in error, 100% of the time, it was already declared heresy--and more than millennium ago. Like the words says in Ecclesiastes 1:9, "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; **there is nothing new under the sun.**" Sometimes, the modern mind will war against, not the idea we cannot come up with new heresies, but the fact that we cannot come up with new theologies and doctrines. But mankind will always try to come up with new ways to lower God to man or elevate man to God. And filed under "fact is sometimes stranger than fiction", when man comes up with a new theology and therefore a new religion, they never give their followers more license to sin but more laws and rules to follow. Imagine that.

### the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding

>John 14:11 (CSB) Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Otherwise, believe because of the works themselves.

>1 Corinthians 8:6 (CSB) yet for us there is one God, the Father. All things are from him, and we exist for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ. All things are through him, and we exist through him.

Every Lord's Day, in my church, [Reforming Truth Church (Lexington, KY)](https://reformingtruth.church) will conclude our Communion with this utterly Triune declaration:

>>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be world without end. Amen.

After singing praises, the hearing of God's law, the Confession of our Sins, the Assurance of Pardon, the Catechism, the Prayers, with the preaching of the Gospel and to take the wine and the bread--our little church boldly and loudly declares this fact: that God is Triune and He is Glorious and He is Eternal! Amen!

### the Son is eternally begotten of the Father

>John 1:14–18 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”) Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three distinct subsistences yet are of one substance.

The Nicene Creed states it as this:

>>true God from true God

And look at Scripture to explain this:

>John 1:1 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

>Colossians 1:15 (CSB) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.

>John 1:14 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Christ is eternally begotten from the Father. That means there was never a time when he was not begotten. He has always been with the Father, living in distinct perfect community.

### the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son

>John 15:26 (CSB) “When the Counselor comes, the one I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—he will testify about me.

TODO:

### all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God

### who is not to be divided in nature and being

### but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations

### which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God

### and comfortable dependence on him

>Galatians 4:6 (CSB) And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”
