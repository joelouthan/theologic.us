## The Text

>Hebrews 6:4-6 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

## The Chapter

```text
As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as the righteous judge, for former sin doth blind and harden; from them he not only withholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in their understanding, and wrought upon their hearts; but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which they had, and exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin; and withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, under those means which God useth for the softening of others.
```

## The Confession

### As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as the righteous judge

>Romans 1:24–28 (CSB) Therefore God delivered them over in the desires of their hearts to sexual impurity, so that their bodies were degraded among themselves. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served what has been created instead of the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen. For this reason God delivered them over to disgraceful passions. Their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. The men in the same way also left natural relations with women and were inflamed in their lust for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the appropriate penalty of their error. And because they did not think it worthwhile to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right.

We have firmly established that God is the first cause all things and by that, he is the creator of angels and men. Although his creation will sin and do evil and he is not the author of their sin, nevertheless, in certain times, by his almighty power, his unsearchable wisdom, and his infinite goodness, he will allow sin to happen.

We clearly see this when the Adam's fall, Judas' betrayal, and the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ. These are events in history that God allowed to happen and in a sense of the word, ordained to happened. He, himself, is not responsible for the sin of mankind. He can do no evil and he is the source of all good.

All that established, that should suffice for those who ponder and ask, "What of personal responsibility?" If God allowed it to happen, can we be held responsible for our sins? If we were robots, then I suppose so. But since we are not robots, the answer is undoubtedly no. 

If God is not the author of sin, then who is the author of sin? That is an incomplete question. The more precise question is, who is the author of your sin?

Your first instinct might be to blameshift to someone else whether that be someone who has caused you great pain or the environment you grew up in or take it all the way, blame Satan for that. Your instincts might suggest that because that is exactly what Adam and Eve did when God confronted them about their sin.

>Genesis 3:11–13 (CSB) Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” The man replied, “The woman you gave to be with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.” So the LORD God asked the woman, “What have you done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

Adam blamed Eve. Eve blamed Satan. But who is at fault for their sin?

We are to blame for we are the author of our sin.

For your sin, you are that author. It is your heart, born in the depravity and wickedness of sin, because of the fall of our first parents, Adam and Eve, that just continually sins endlessly. For:

>Genesis 6:5 (CSB) When the LORD saw that human wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time,

### for former sin doth blind and harden

>Romans 11:7–8 (CSB) What then? Israel did not find what it was looKing for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that cannot see and ears that cannot hear, to this day.

One of the greatest mysteries is the mystery of sin. The foremost reason why, because of sin and because we are not God, we cannot fully understand and comprehend the depth of destruction that sin has or will caused. Sometimes, we know after it happens. In some sin, like in traumatic sin against you, it will blind you in such a way you will not see the sin that was even committed against you. And in the worst cases, you will commit sin against others because of the sin that has blinded you and hardened your heart.

It is like you dig into a manure pit and the more you dig, all you find is more crap.

### from them he not only withholdeth his grace

>Deuteronomy 29:4 (CSB) Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear.

>Isaiah 6:9–10 (CSB) And he replied: Go! Say to these people: Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looKing, but do not perceive. Make the minds of these people dull; deafen their ears and blind their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed.

If God alone has to exchange your heart, deposit his Spirit, give you his only begotten Son, give you faith to believe, repentance of sin, a renewed mind, opened eyes, new soul, and ears to hear just for your to be saved, then by the Scriptures alone, for the wicked and ungodly, God will not only not give them his grace and not unveil his glory but rather, give them over to their own sin.

### whereby they might have been enlightened in their understanding

>Matthew 13:12 (CSB) For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have more than enough; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

And you might think to yourself, "Just how wicked must someone be for God to do that?!" In the previous subchapter, I mentioned of King Manasseh of his unadulterated wicked against the only good God for God not to turn him over to his sins but that save him from his sins. [^1689-5-5]

[^1689-5-5]: Aforementioned in [1689 5.5 The Discipline of God](https://theologic.us/posts/confession-1689/1689-5-5-the-discipline-of-god/#and-to-raise-them-to-a-more-close-and-constant-dependence-for-their-support-upon-himself)

I think is question is not "how much can we sin before God will turn us over to our sin?" but rather, "Who is like our God and who can compare to him?" For:

>Isaiah 55:8–9 (CSB) “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways.” This is the LORD’s declaration. “For as heaven is higher than earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

And:

>Isaiah 40:28 (CSB) Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the whole earth. He never becomes faint or weary; there is no limit to his understanding.

Even still:

>Isaiah 46:9–10 (CSB) Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and no one is like me. I declare the end from the beginning, and from long ago what is not yet done, saying: my plan will take place, and I will do all my will.

### and wrought upon their hearts

>Deuteronomy 2:30 (CSB) But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you, as has now taken place.

What we have seen time and time again is that what we can surmise is God has chosen to give the wicked and ungodly over to exactly what they want. For:

>Psalm 81:12 (CSB) So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own plans.

>Psalm 106:15 (CSB) He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.

It is the same God who shines the sun on the good and evil, and rains on just and unjust. It is the same God who saves his people from their sins and gives those not his people over to their sins.

### but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which they had

>2 Kings 8:12–13 (CSB) and Hazael asked, “Why is my lord weeping?” He replied, “Because I know the evil you will do to the people of Israel. You will set their fortresses on fire. You will kill their young men with the sword. You will dash their children to pieces. You will rip open their pregnant women.” Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, do such a mighty deed?” Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will be King over Aram.”

This doctrine is not to be confused with:

>Romans 11:28–29 (CSB) Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of the patriarchs, since God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable.

but rather is to be understood as:

>Hebrews 6:4-6 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

There are some of us, within our churches in the past, present, and future, will inevitably be attracted to the power of the Holy Spirit. They might see a little, taste a little and see that God is undeniably good, might participate in the works of the Holy Spirit, who sit under the preaching of the word, and in the powers of the age to come, only to fall away.

This should not be a mystery to any of us. Our Lord Jesus Christ already taught on this:

>Matthew 13:18-23 (CSB) “So listen to the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word about the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path. And the one sown on rocky ground — this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. But he has no root and is short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away. Now the one sown among the thorns — this is one who hears the word, but the worries of this age and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. But the one sown on the good ground — this is one who hears and understands the word, who does produce fruit and yields: some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”

Christ already taught that just because of preached word of God by the power of the Holy Spirit, some will hear and either don't understand it; think it is fantastic but tap out when life gets too difficult; or circumstances of this life are too good and they haven't figured out how to make God for them--so they fall away.

This happens all the time. And I imagine to guess you know someone who has fallen away. I know I do.

What should we do in these times?

Keep in mind that where people are at now is not where they will be at in the end. Know that God is the perfect Father in heaven who has never lost one of kids, and the Lord Jesus who has not lost one of his sheep. And lastly and mostly importantly, pray that God would rescue them.

### and exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin

>Psalm 81:11–12 (CSB) “But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel did not obey me. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own plans.

God does not tempt anyone but again, in the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, he does allow temptations to come upon us. For:

>James 1:13-14 (CSB) No one undergoing a trial should say, “I am being tempted by God,” since God is not tempted by evil, and he himself doesn’t tempt anyone. But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desire.

And:

>1 Corinthians 10:13 (CSB) No temptation has come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful; he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to bear it.

The giving over to our sins is a powerful damning of the Lord. You might wonder if this can happen to you.

Let me contend to you if you wonder this, take heart: God is with you. If you desire the presence of God, then be blessed, you are with God. Let the Spirit of God give you peace that belongs to you in Christ Jesus. Do not let the Satan and the world cause you to despair.

This is where instead of fleeing in isolation, we flee to the God of grace. Instead of wallowing in confusion, we pray to God for clarity and understanding. And if we doubt, God's promises are still yes and amen.

My child, it is not based on your the strength of your faith. You and I are weak and feeble. But our faith, given to us by God, is upon God who alone is Almighty. He has you. Christ has you. Spirit has sealed you. If you doubt and your faith is little, Christ still has you close to his bosom.

### and withal

>2 Thessalonians 2:10–12 (CSB) and with every wicked deception among those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe the lie, so that all will be condemned—those who did not believe the truth but delighted in unrighteousness.

For his people, he has never forgotten nor forsaken. For those whom he has hated, he flees from them.

>Psalm 11:5 (CSB) The LORD examines the righteous, but he hates the wicked and those who love violence.

>Psalm 5:5 (CSB) The boastful cannot stand in your sight; you hate all evildoers.

It is the mercies of God that holds his arms wide open until the day he does not. 

### gives them over to their own lusts

>Exodus 8:15–32 (CSB) But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said. Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land, and it will become gnats throughout the land of Egypt.” And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and when he struck the dust of the land, gnats were on people and animals. All the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of Egypt. The magicians tried to produce gnats using their occult practices, but they could not. The gnats remained on people and animals. “This is the finger of God,” the magicians said to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said. The LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh when you see him going out to the water. Tell him: This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. But if you will not let my people go, then I will send swarms of flies against you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The Egyptians’ houses will swarm with flies, and so will the land where they live. But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where my people are living; no flies will be there. This way you will know that I, the LORD, am in the land. I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.” And the LORD did this. Thick swarms of flies went into Pharaoh’s palace and his officials’ houses. Throughout Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies. Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go sacrifice to your God within the country.” But Moses said, “It would not be right to do that, because what we will sacrifice to the LORD our God is detestable to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what the Egyptians detest in front of them, won’t they stone us? We must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he instructs us.” Pharaoh responded, “I will let you go and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but don’t go very far. Make an appeal for me.” “As soon as I leave you,” Moses said, “I will appeal to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceptively again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD.” Then Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD. The LORD did as Moses had said: He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people; not one was left. But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go.

God sent Moses and Aaron to preach the gospel, "You are not a god but I am. And I have heard the cries of my people and I will save them."

>Romans 9:17 (CSB) For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth.

### the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan

>Isaiah 6:9–10 (CSB) And he replied: Go! Say to these people: Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looKing, but do not perceive. Make the minds of these people dull; deafen their ears and blind their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed.

And it is God who hardened the heart of Pharaoh and Pharaoh, driven with madness from sin, caused the death of his firstborn son, his army, and himself.

God turned him over to his own lusts for power.

### whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, under those means which God useth for the softening of others

>1 Peter 2:7–8 (CSB) So honor will come to you who believe; but for the unbelieving, The stone that the builders rejected— this one has become the cornerstone, and A stone to stumble over, and a rock to trip over. They stumble because they disobey the word; they were destined for this.

>Romans 9:22-26 (CSB) And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory — on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? As it also says in Hosea,  
>  
>**I will call Not My People, My People,  
>and she who is Unloved, Beloved.  
>And it will be in the place where they were told,  
>you are not my people,  
>there they will be called sons of the living God.**

Paul in Romans 9 pulls back the curtain a little bit on the sovereignty of God in salvation. Evangelicals, especially those decidedly non-Calvinist, have interpreted Romans 9, 10 & 11, in that it pertains only to Israel and not to the Church--as though God is not the same God yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

>Romans 9:16-19 (CSB) So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden. You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will? ”

In other words, God is not above raising and lowering and even marKing someone as an object of wrath in order to save his people who were marked as objects of mercy.

God alone gives mercy. God alone gives grace. God alone is compassionate. God alone saves.

Pharaoh in his own sin turned over to the deepest desires of his heart. To the people of God, he saved them for nothing they have done but rather everything he is--good, glory, and grace.

Do you not think that the hardening of Pharaoh's heart was on full display not only to Moses and his people but to the people of Egypt as well? God was aptly proclaiming, "Choose on this day whom you will serve!" The God of the greatest power is the same God who is the greatest redeemer. He had stopped at nothing in order to rescue his people from the bondage of sin and death.

The rising and lower of another King happened again in the Bible. But this King was not wicked nor cruel nor narcissistic. This King loved the Lord his God and he loved his people with all of his might. His people were wicked and not did love God. They have turned away from God and they worshipped their own gods. But this King was not moved by the sins of his people but rather mercies and compassion and the steadfast love he had for them. For they were his and he was theirs.

And this King was not made to lower after being in glory forever past but rather "for the joy that lay before him, he endured the cross, despising the shame". (Hebrews 12:2) 

And at the same time, the King was being lowered unto death on the cross, God raised him up, for:

>John 3:14-15 (CSB) Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

And:

>John 12:32 (CSB) As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.”

The Pharaoh was a king who was low as a baby, brought high by God and then brought low unto for his own sins in order the name of God would be glorified and the salvation of his people would be made known.

Jesus is the Son of God who is God was always in glory with the Father and the Spirit. He was low as a baby, lived the perfect life that the people of God should have lived. But he too was brought low unto death on the cross not for his own sins but rather the sins of his people in order the name of God would be glorified and the salvation of his people not only be made known but also be perfectly, eternally, completely, and fully accomplished. And now Jesus is glorified by the Father as King of kings and Lord of lords forever and ever. Amen.
