TODO:

## The Chapter

```text
The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience to him as their creator, yet they could never have attained the reward of life but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant.
```

## The Confession

### The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience to him as their creator

>Luke 17:10 (CSB) In the same way, when you have done all that you were commanded, you should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we’ve only done our duty.’ ”

### yet they could never have attained the reward of life but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant

>Job 35:7–8 (CSB) If you are righteous, what do you give him, or what does he receive from your hand? Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, and your righteousness, a son of man.
