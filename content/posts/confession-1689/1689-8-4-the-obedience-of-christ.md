## The Text

>1 John 4:10 (ESV) In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

## The Chapter

```text
This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake, which that he might discharge he was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it, and underwent the punishment due to us, which we should have borne and suffered, being made sin and a curse for us; enduring most grievous sorrows in his soul, and most painful sufferings in his body; was crucified, and died, and remained in the state of the dead, yet saw no corruption: on the third day he arose from the dead with the same body in which he suffered, with which he also ascended into heaven, and there sitteth at the right hand of his Father making intercession, and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world.
```

## The Confession

### This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake

>Psalm 40:7–8 (CSB) Then I said, “See, I have come; in the scroll it is written about me. I delight to do your will, my God, and your instruction is deep within me.”

>Hebrews 10:5–10 (CSB) Therefore, as he was coming into the world, he said: You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You did not delight in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings. Then I said, “See— it is written about me in the scroll— I have come to do your will, God.” After he says above, You did not desire or delight in sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings and sin offerings (which are offered according to the law), he then says, See, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first to establish the second. By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.

>John 10:18 (CSB) No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”

### which that He might discharge He was made under the law

>Galatians 4:4 (CSB) When the time came to completion, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

>Matthew 3:15 (CSB) Jesus answered him, “Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John allowed him to be baptized.

### and did perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the punishment due to us, which we should have born and suffered

>Galatians 3:13 (CSB) Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.

>Isaiah 53:6 (CSB) We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the LORD has punished him for the iniquity of us all.

>1 Peter 3:18 (CSB) For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,

### being made sin and a curse for us

>2 Corinthians 5:21 (CSB) He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

### enduring most grievous sorrows in His soul, and most painful sufferings in His body

>Matthew 26:37–38 (CSB) Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. He said to them, “I am deeply grieved to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”

>Luke 22:44 (CSB) Being in anguish, he prayed more fervently, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.

>Matthew 27:46 (CSB) About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Elí, Elí, lemá sabachtháni?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”

### was crucified, and died, and remained in the state of the dead, yet saw no corruption

>Acts 13:37 (CSB) but the one God raised up did not decay.

### on the third day He arose from the dead

>1 Corinthians 15:3–4 (CSB) For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,

### with the same body in which He suffered

>John 20:25–27 (CSB) So the other disciples were telling him, “We’ve seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “If I don’t see the mark of the nails in his hands, put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe.” A week later his disciples were indoors again, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Don’t be faithless, but believe.”

### with which He also ascended into heaven

>Mark 16:19 (CSB) So the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.

>Acts 1:9–11 (CSB) After he had said this, he was taken up as they were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going, they were gazing into heaven, and suddenly two men in white clothes stood by them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you have seen him going into heaven.”

### and there sits at the right hand of His Father making intercession

>Romans 8:34 (CSB) Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.

>Hebrews 9:24 (CSB) For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model of the true one) but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God for us.

### and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world

>Acts 10:42 (CSB) He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.

>Romans 14:9–10 (CSB) Christ died and returned to life for this: that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living. But you, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.

>Acts 1:11 (CSB) They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you have seen him going into heaven.”

>2 Peter 2:4 (CSB) For if God didn’t spare the angels who sinned but cast them into hell and delivered them in chains of utter darkness to be kept for judgment;
