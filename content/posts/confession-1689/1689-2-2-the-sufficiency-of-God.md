## The Text

>Romans 11:33–36 (CSB)  
><sup>33</sup> Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways! 

><sup>34</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? 

><sup>35</sup> And who has ever given to God, that he should be repaid? 

><sup>36</sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.

## The Chapter

```text
God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself all- sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them; he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain; he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands; to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

## The Confession

God did not need us = mind blowing objection to our modern minds because we all need something. The American independence twists this into we don’t need anything but others need me. And the suppression of the truth of God = God must need me. 

But we are created from the Creator. Romans 9

Made us not he needed anything but the overflow of his love 1 John 4. Eph 1. Romans 8:30. Eph 2. 

… does what he pleases 

Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised 

Exposit Romans 1:18-26

“God is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient. God is all-sufficient not only in Himself, but also for Himself, in the absolute sense, needing nothing from any creature. Christians often use expressions that are well meaning but that, if analyzed carefully, approach blasphemy. For example, “I’m so glad that so-and-so allowed God to work through him,” or “Thank you for letting God work through you.” Does this mean that God cannot work through me unless I allow Him? God does not need our permission to do anything, any more than He needed Paul’s permission to appear to him on the Damascus road, or Judas’ to use him for His greater glory, or that of Balaam’s ass to speak prophetically. God is self-sufficient, both in Himself and for Himself.”

“Most Christians claim to believe that God has the right to rule over us, yet we belie that confession by committing sin. We try to impose our will as if it were higher than His.”

### in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature

Vs open theism Romans 3:25-26

Sees what we do. Sees the depths of hearts 

### so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain

Molinism 

### he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands

Clay potter who are you Romans 9

>Leviticus 11:45(CSB) For I am the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy.

### to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them

Genesis 15, Gen 1-2 made to worship him because he is due 

The wickedness and folly of man is why does God get to be worship and the glory and you would be right if God was a man. But he is not created. He is God. Something about being a son of Adam that either try to degrade or humble God to the status of man Isa 53 or raise man to the status of God. In other words we suppress the truth of God so that we can make him like us so we can turn judge him and criticize him and dismiss him when he doesn’t give us what we want. 

The 1689 summarizes and teaches from the Bible that God is high and exalted far above all other gods

Nebuchadnezzar Found out the hard way. Daniel 4

2 Chronicles - King Manasseh vs 2 Kings account 

He is not a powerful being that toys with the affairs of mankind. Capricious and whimsical and diabolical and manipulative. He is God alone who has all power and might and sovereignty and grace and love and mercy. Fullest thereof. Not split.
