## The Chapter

```text
God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them; he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain; he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands; to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

## The Confession

### God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself

I am not sure if we, Evangelicals, still believe this or not. But for the sake of covering my bases, let me state this.

God does not need anything.

And just so we are clear:

God does not need us.

I could try to paint a picture of a perfectly content Father and a perfectly content Son in perfect harmonious community joined by the Holy Spirit. To be honest, it would be a feeble attempt. Because we cannot imagine such a relationship on this side of heaven.

I could walk into any room with any amount of people and ask for a show of hands who here has known anybody who has gotten divorced. The raised hands would be 100%. Yet, when God gave marriage to mankind, his intention and design was always forever. Never broken. Never fractured.

We cannot not imagine unbroken marriage. Sinless relationships. Complete joy-filled unions. We can't but this is all God knew forever. There was no other reality for him.

And why is that. To speak about God is that we cannot simply stop at "he is good" which he is. And he is blessedness or glory or life which he is all these things. But what sets him apart from his creation is that he is the fullness of these things. And if he is truly filled to the max, perfectly with these things, then he does not need anything.

And if is filled with these things--all life, glory, goodness, blessedness--then what else does he need. He certainly did not need us. R.C. Sproul says it this way:

>>“God is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient. God is all-sufficient not only in Himself, but also for Himself, in the absolute sense, needing nothing from any creature. Christians often use expressions that are well meaning but that, if analyzed carefully, approach blasphemy. For example, “I’m so glad that so-and-so allowed God to work through him,” or “Thank you for letting God work through you.” Does this mean that God cannot work through me unless I allow Him? God does not need our permission to do anything, any more than He needed Paul’s permission to appear to him on the Damascus road, or Judas’ to use him for His greater glory, or that of Balaam’s ass to speak prophetically. God is self-sufficient, both in Himself and for Himself.”
>>
>>R. C. Sproul. Truths We Confess. 55-57.

### all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them

Often times, I have shared the story of the loss of my brother who passed away in 2020 from Stage 4 Colon Cancer. And after so much loss, you would think I would be comfortable with grieving. And been on this earth for nearly 50 years, I don't automatically grieve loss and sin and betrayal. And the reason why is because instead of grieving and sitting in that sadness and feeling the sadness, I avoid it. I avoid it like that the plague. But I turn my heart instead of the one God who can comfort me and instead turn to a much darker plague: porn.

Summer of 2022, the perfect storm for Satan to release his barrage of temptations would come my way. My wife was going on an international trip for work. And I was at home by myself. But during this, I started experiencing a physical pain and ailment that immediately took me back to my dying brother in his pain and agony. And helping the nurse lift and turn his lifeless cancer ridden body. This little bit of physical grief struck me with fear that I, too, had cancer like my brother.

And I turned to porn like I had nearly all of my life.

Five minutes into fulfilling my temptation, God quickened me. He brought me back to life. My mind and heart got powered on and I was made alive. I quickly dismissed my sin and repented to my God and my wife and my friends as fast as I could.

I sinned against God knowing full well that he alone is life, goodness, blessedness and glory. He is holy, kind, and merciful, righteousness.

I chose to sin against the Almighty God.

In all of his glory and his power and his might, how did God respond to my treasonous sin?

The Father, who has sent his Son to live and die for me, who has sent his Spirit to give me his heart secure me to him forever decided that it would be this year he would save my oldest son.

And then he would save my other son--fully saving the men in my generations from my grandfather to my youngest son. He waited, in his good pleasure and grace, waited until my grandfather was 40 and my dad was 56 and myself when I was 32 to save us. But then he saves my 20 year old son and my 9 year son in a blink of an eye.

He gave me mercy.

Oh. Because my God is good and he alone is good and he overflows with goodness, he granted me the one desire I had in my heart for the entire time I have known and loved him--

He allowed me to preach his gospel for the first time ever.

I sinned. And God responded with ultimate goodness and mercy.

This is my God.

### but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them

And through my life, he has chosen to reveal his glory. Through ministering to others, he has shown to be tender in heart and full of compassion. By his preached word and the power of the Spirit through His Son, he has rescued his people from their sins.

We have no other source for life, glory, goodness, and blessedness but God alone.

### he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth

We are never to be the source of anything good because we are not.

>Romans 3:10–12 (CSB) as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away; all alike have become worthless. There is no one who does what is good, not even one.

When we need to be good, we must run to the source of all good.

Paul states it bluntly:

>Romans 9:14-18 (CSB) What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.

God alone gives us mercy.

So if God didn't need us, why did he create us?

>1 John 4:7-10 (CSB) Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

>Ephesians 2:1-5 (CSB) nd you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

Because God is love. And he was mindful of us before Genesis 1:1. For:

>Ephesians 1:3-6 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.

He made up his mind that he was going to create us, save us, and keep us forever.

### in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature
TODO:
Vs open theism 

>Romans 3:25–26 (CSB) God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

Sees what we do. Sees the depths of hearts 

### so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain

Molinism 

### he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands

Clay potter who are you Romans 9

>Leviticus 11:45(CSB) For I am the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy.

### to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them

Genesis 15, Gen 1-2 made to worship him because he is due 

The wickedness and folly of man is why does God get to be worship and the glory and you would be right if God was a man. But he is not created. He is God. Something about being a son of Adam that either try to degrade or humble God to the status of man Isa 53 or raise man to the status of God. In other words we suppress the truth of God so that we can make him like us so we can turn judge him and criticize him and dismiss him when he doesn’t give us what we want. 

The 1689 summarizes and teaches from the Bible that God is high and exalted far above all other gods

Nebuchadnezzar Found out the hard way. Daniel 4

2 Chronicles - King Manasseh vs 2 Kings account 

He is not a powerful being that toys with the affairs of mankind. Capricious and whimsical and diabolical and manipulative. He is God alone who has all power and might and sovereignty and grace and love and mercy. Fullest thereof. Not split.
