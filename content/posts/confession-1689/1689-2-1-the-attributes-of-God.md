## The Chapter

```text
The Lord our God is but one only living and true God; whose subsistence is in and of himself, infinite in being and perfection; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself; a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; who is immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, every way infinite, most holy, most wise, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will for his own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withal most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

## The Confession

This is loaded chapter. Because right out out the gate, after solidifying the confessions on the Scriptures, we go right into answering the question:

*Who is God?*

And the Historical Confessions (WCF, Savor, and 2LBC) front loads Chapter 2 on Theology with the attributes of God. Systematically speaking, it starts with the incommunicable attributes--the attributes that belong to God alone, while finishing it off with the communicable attributes of God--namely, those attributes that are shared with the imagebearers of God, that is, mankind. 

Another way of seeing these attributes organized is Richard Muller defined it. In *To the Judicious and Impartial Reader: Baptist Symbolics Volume 2*, Dr. Renihan attributes the following terms from Richard Muller's *Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms (2nd edition)*:

>>“*Archetypal theology* is “the infinite knowledge of God known only to God himself” while *ectypal theology* is “all true finite theology, defined as a reflection of the divine archetype.”
>>
>>Renihan. Baptist Symbolics Volume 2. 162.

To learn these attributes, we must examine them bit by bit and connect them with the appropriate declaration from Scripture.

### The Lord our God

>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 (CSB) “Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead. Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates.

From his book, *Baptist Symbolics Volume 2.*, Dr. Renihan spots something that I missed, "the paragraph begins with a personalized assertion about God—He is ours.”[^1] Whatever God wants to reveal about himself to us, it will not be everything about God but it will be *truly* about God and we, as his people, know him truly. Let the world say what they want about our God. But the maker of the heavens and the earth, the Almighty God, from everlasting to everlasting, belongs to his people. God belongs to me. For I am my Beloved's and He is mine forever. [^2] God personally belongs to me and I personally belong to him. For:

>Exodus 19:5-6 (CSB) Now if you will carefully listen to me and keep my covenant, you will be my own possession out of all the peoples, although the whole earth is mine, and you will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.”

And

>Exodus 34:8-9 (CSB) Moses immediately knelt low on the ground and worshiped. Then he said, “My Lord, if I have indeed found favor with you, my Lord, please go with us (even though this is a stiff-necked people), forgive our iniquity and our sin, and accept us as your own possession.”

And

>Deuteronomy 26:16-19 (CSB) “The LORD your God is commanding you this day to follow these statutes and ordinances. Follow them carefully with all your heart and all your soul. Today you have affirmed that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in his ways, keep his statutes, commands, and ordinances, and obey him. And today the LORD has affirmed that you are his own possession as he promised you, that you are to keep all his commands, that he will elevate you to praise, fame, and glory above all the nations he has made, and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God as he promised.”

And

>Titus 2:11-14 (CSB) For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works.

There is only one response to this absolute and blessed truth: praise be to God! We get to worship the the Lord *our* God all because of what his Son has done for us. Today is the day we give thanks to him for he alone is good and his steadfast love endures forever.

[^1]: Renihan. Baptist Symbolics Volume 2. 167
[^2]: Song of Songs 2:16

### is but one 

>1 Corinthians 8:4–6 (CSB) About eating food sacrificed to idols, then, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world,” and that “there is no God but one.” For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as there are many “gods” and many “lords”—yet for us there is one God, the Father. All things are from him, and we exist for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ. All things are through him, and we exist through him.

John Calvin said it succinctly:

>>Man's nature is a perpetual factory of idols

Certainly, Satan rules the air. Demons, or principalities, rule regions. From the fall of humanity, we certainly will conjure up and put our trust in a little god who we hoped will make this life a little bit easier. Sadly, Satan, demons, and our idols have zero power. They can only kill, deceive, twist, oppress, and when it comes to our idols, do absolutely nothing for our lives.

>Deuteronomy 6:4 (CSB) “Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.

In terms of power, holiness, righteousness, sinlessness, perfection, merciful, kind, gracious, patience, deliver, savior, and of course, love, there is only one and he is the Triune God--Father, Son, and Spirit--who reigns forever and ever. Amen

### only living true God

>Jeremiah 10:10 (CSB) But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and eternal King. The earth quakes at his wrath, and the nations cannot endure his fury.

>Isaiah 48:12 (CSB) “Listen to me, Jacob, and Israel, the one called by me: I am he; I am the first, I am also the last.

>Exodus 3:14 (CSB) God replied to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.”

God is not idle. God does not cease. He is not dormant. God is living. That he moves and speaks and is quite personal with his creation.

God is not a figment of mankind's imagination. God was not conjured up by man. Mankind will certainly make God out to be something he is not. But that does not make it true. God is true. He is the source of truth. Whatever he says or does is truth and absolute. We can only see semblances of the truth unless our eyes and ears and hearts and minds fall on the one true living God.

### whose subsistence is in and of himself, infinite in being and perfection; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself; a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts

>John 4:24 (CSB) God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and in truth.”

>Deuteronomy 4:15–16 (CSB) “Diligently watch yourselves—because you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb—so you don’t act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form,

The best word to describe the simplicity of God is *aseity*. Webster's properly defines this:

>> the quality or state of being self-derived or self-originated specifically : **the absolute self-sufficiency, independence, and autonomy of God**

God is not like anything in all creation in that one, he is not made up of complex parts and two, he is not created. God is simply one essence. He in of himself is God. He has no beginning nor end. No one made him. He is the maker of all things and all people. The Mormon religion states that their god existed as a mortal man in another universe and when he came to our universe, that's when he became god. The gods of other religions, cults, and sects--even the gods of other so-called Christian groups who fall outside of Christian orthodoxy--are built up in the minds of man and incredibly more complex than the one true living God. God sustains himself. God is joy and love unto and from himself. God did not need to make mankind. The Triune God was in perfect harmony, unity, community within himself because God is love. From all things and all truth overflows out from God.

### or passions

This is the divine impassibility of God--God does not suffer or feels pain. You see in the Bible that in dealing with our trespasses and treason, God would describe himself as "jealous" or "wrathful" but these are not feelings born out of passion or feelings nor a reaction. These are words to describe how sin is an affront--an abomination--to his very simple nature.

>Malachi 3:6 (CSB) “Because I, the LORD, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.

Could you imagine if God could suffer or feel pain? Who wants to feel pain? When you feel pain, don't you want the pain to quickly stop? When you suffer, do you want the suffering to keep going a little or stop? You would want it to stop now right. If God felt suffering and pain, he would make it instantly right. He would have justly terminated all of mankind and started all over.

We love our little gods because they are made in our own image. When we change, our idols can change with us. When we suffer or feel pain, they change with us yet we worship these idols like they are going to save us--how can they save us when they are like us?

God is not like us. God is not moved by his personal suffering. You cannot pain or hurt God. God is love and he moves base on himself. I wouldn't want to make the mistake, in our day and age, to say, "God is moved by love" because mankind is desperately trying to redefine and reimage and twist the word "love", make it ultimate law, and then have God submit himself and work through our new definition of love.

God is love. We have our definition of love. And only one is correct.

### who only hath immortality

>1 Timothy 1:17 (CSB) Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

If God the one true living God, within the immortality of God, not only will he live forever but he has always lived from eternity past.

### dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto

>John 1:1-5 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. **In him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it.**

Because we have been born into and choose to sin, we can approach God. We cannot come to him on our own. John Stott in his book, *The Cross of Christ*, gave five descriptions on how God is far from our sin. One of those descriptions: God is brightest. We cannot dare approach him just in the light of his glory and goodness.

>>I am in sweet communion with Christ as a poor sinner can be; and am only pained that he hath much beauty and fairness, and I little love; he great power and mercy, and I little faith; he much light and I bleared eyes.
>>
>>Samuel Rutherford. The Loveliness of Christ.

Because of our present state, if we looked upon God, we would die. We could not approach God. Therefore, God must come to us. Immanuel--God is with us. In order for us to be with God, God must come to us. This is the only way. Christ is the only way.

### who is immutable

Impassibility and immutability are words we don't often use and they can be a bit confusing. Think about it like this:

God is not changed by anything that can happen to him--**impassibility**.

God is not changed from the inside out--**immutability**.

Here is the real kick: humans are always changed from the outside in. When something devastatingly tragic happens to a human, that person is changed forever unless they go and get real help. That is called trauma.

I experienced painful trauma as a kid. While those around me thought I was okay, inside I was messed up and jacked up. And that brokenness never surfaced until I went through not one but two divorces. You think God hates divorce? I went it through it twice over. Twice the pain. Twice the loss. Twice the torment. Twice the agony. Twice the shame. I would never wish divorce on my worst enemy.

I was changed from the outside in.

God is not like me at all. All the sin and anger and hate that God has to deal with, he is not traumatize from that and changed from the outside in.

Likewise, there is nothing in God that makes him dwell on his own thoughts, feelings, emotions, beliefs, philosophies of the day and changes himself from the inside out. 

God is not whimsical nor capricious. He does not do things that he does just because he feels like it. He has and will forever will be God.

In other words, the gospel is forever the gospel. God changes us from the inside out by making his home in us and dwelling in us forever. That good news was there when sin first broke all of creation and in a million years, it will always be the good news--that God saves sinners.

I find it fascinating when humans want something else not the word of God to give them a free pass on a sin that they want to keep doing. "I want to be prideful--God look the other way please!" and then twist Scriptures accordingly. Or the world want us to approve of their behavior and have us look the other way on their sin. Who are we? We are nobody. We are just his Bride. We are not the Bridegroom. Christ is God. You might say, "But I struggle with sin and I cannot escape it." God knew that. I sin everyday. God already knew that. That is why he sent his Son to live and die for me. You want in on this good news? It is there for the taking. Ask for Christ, you are going to get Christ.

### immense

>1 Kings 8:27 (CSB) But will God indeed live on earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain you, much less this temple I have built.

>Numbers 14:21 (CSB) Yet as I live and as the whole earth is filled with the LORD’s glory,

The *immensity* of God speaks to the omnipresence of God--God is everywhere at all times. That is not say God is in everything--that is would be *pantheism*. And we know that not be the case because nothing of God dwells or resides in the unbelievers.

I think it will be reasonable to comprehend the Father and the Spirit to be everywhere at all times because they are spirit. But what about the Second Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ, who took on flesh and dwelled among us? The Apostle Paul states it perfectly:

>Colossians 1:15–20 (CSB) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and by him all things hold together. He is also the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. **For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.**

In terms of what Christ did, as fully God and fully man, the Apostle John states:

>John 21:25 (CSB) And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if every one of them were written down, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.

To sum up *immenseness* of God, God is not just everywhere at all times but where you are at right now, God is with you right now. He is Jehovah-Shammah--God is there.

>Ezekiel 48:35 (CSB) The perimeter of the city will be six miles, and the name of the city from that day on will be **The LORD Is There.**”

### eternal

>Psalm 90:2 (CSB) Before the mountains were born, before you gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, you are God.

>Revelation 22:12-13 (CSB) “Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me to repay each person according to his work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

John Calvin wrote:

>> finitum non capax infiniti

In other words, "the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite." If there is one attribute of God that is the hardest for us to grasp, I suggest it would be the eternality of God.

It is easy for us to quote Moses in Psalm 90, "from eternity to eternity, you are God." But to state that absolute fact and believe that absolute fact has implication.

For one, God is the Creator of all creation and he is before all things.

>Genesis 1:1 (CSB) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

>John 1:1-3 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.

Nothing created him and he is before all created things. There wasn't a moment in time that God was not there. What is true for any point in the past is absolutely true for the future. Any moment in the future, God is already there. And when he relates to us, he always uses temporal terms despite being outside of time.

What is even more amazing, within those temporal terms, when the Son of God took on flesh, he subjected himself not only to his material plane and the effects of the corruption of sin but he subjected himself to the constraints of time like we are.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God who is God, "grew in stature and wisdom"[^3] and preached the gospel [^4] and minister to others with the same contraints of time and space as we do. In other words, Christ did not commission us with something he did not do himself.

[^3]: Luke 2:40
[^4]: Mark 1:14

### incomprehensible

In continuing with the Calvin's statement, eternality of God is one thing but the fact that we cannot comprehend him in our natural state is something humbling.

Those who contend for the free will of man in their own salvation will, after much consideration, will have to conclude that if the mortal man can learn 2+2=4, then God is a fact that can be learned.

But God is not a school subject. He is not an academic course. He is not a science project. He is not an undiscovered element. The modern mind wants to so desperately treat God as if he is just another major study at the local college. But the Scripture make it crystal clear:

>1 Corinthians 2:7–16 (CSB)  
><sup> 7  </sup>On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined before the ages for our glory. 

><sup> 8  </sup>None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, because if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 

><sup> 9  </sup>But as it is written, What no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived— God has prepared these things for those who love him. 

><sup> 10  </sup>Now God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, since the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. 

><sup> 11  </sup>For who knows a person’s thoughts except his spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 

><sup> 12  </sup>Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God. 

><sup> 13  </sup>We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people. 

><sup> 14  </sup>But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually. 

><sup> 15  </sup>The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, and yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone. 

><sup> 16  </sup>For who has known the Lord’s mind, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

In other words, knowledge of God is supernatural and not natural. Something outside of us must reveal God to us. And throughout the Scriptures, we know that it must be God that reveals himself to us for us to know, believe, trust, and obey Him. No exceptions.

Let me take it one step further: do you believe that the Scriptures are another literary work or are the inspired by God?

>2 Timothy 3:14-17 (CSB) But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you, and you know that from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. **All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.**

If it is inspired by God, then the word of God comes from God alone. If it comes from God alone, it is supernatural. If it is supernatural, then how are we to even comprehend the word of God?

Only if God reveals it to us. In other words, only if God opens our eyes. For:

>Hebrews 6:1-3 (CSB) Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God, teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. **And we will do this if God permits.**

And

>Mark 8:22-25 (CSB) They came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village. Spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on him, he asked him, “Do you see anything? ” He looked up and said, “I see people — they look like trees walking.” Again Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes. The man looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly.

You might say, "Are you saying we cannot know God at all?"

Can we fully know God? No. But can we *truly* know him? Absolutely. How do I know this? He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to live and die for us.

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

### almighty

>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, “I am God Almighty. Live in my presence and be blameless.

>Revelation 4:8 (CSB) Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,  
>Holy, holy, holy,  
>Lord God, the Almighty,  
>who was, who is, and who is to come.

In the most simplistic way, almighty is a contraction of two words, "all" and "mighty". That is too say, all-might. If we have a hard time grasping the ever-existence of God, I think we really do no fathom what it means for God to be omnipotent. And the reason why is throughout all of history, man, in his frailty and weakness, has strived and fought for power.

>Genesis 6:4 (CSB) The Nephilim were on the earth both in those days and afterward, when the sons of God came to the daughters of mankind, who bore children to them. **They were the powerful men of old, the famous men.**

Yet God says:

>Proverbs 16:5 (CSB) Everyone with a proud heart is detestable to the LORD; be assured, he will not go unpunished.

In my Genesis commentary, I wrote this about verse 4:

>>We live in a culture that celebrates the powerful and the famous. If we are not too careful we might look at that line and think nothing of it. But God declares prideful men and women “detestable”.

We power grab everything. We even will construct entire theologies over power structures. 

On my best day, I can deadlift over 500 pounds, squat 470, and leg press over a thousand. And nearly every time I step into a gym or my hand folds over and grips iron or steel, I humbling reminded that the atoms of this weight plate is being actively held together by the crucified Son of Man.

>Colossians 1:17 (CSB) He is before all things, and by him all things hold together.

What is my mere weight lifting compared to the Almighty King who holds the universe in his hands? I cannot comprehend.

But who alone can swap my heart of stone, give me his own loving soft tender heart and places his Spirit within me so that God and His Son can make their home in me? This is too astounding to embrace.

That is true strength.

>Ephesians 6:10 (CSB) Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.

This Almighty God now has given us his strength and grace to do his will. Blessed be his name.

### every way infinite

Take these attributes of God--*immensity, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty*--and to measure them is without end. You cannot measure them. And the attributes of God are not infinite with a contained area (like our universe) but rather, he is infinite and we, in our place, world, and galaxy, is quite, quite limited in comparison.

### most holy

>Isaiah 6:2-3 (CSB) Seraphim were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another:  
>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies;  
>his glory fills the whole earth.

R.C. Sproul is famous for correctly stating:

>>The Bible doesn't say God is "love, love, love," or "grace, grace, grace." The Bible says He is "holy, holy, holy."

Holiness of God is revealed by God in one of two ways. One, our sinfulness and far from Him we really are. Two, his absolute moral perfection. Sproul sums up nicely in this way:

>>“That attribution of greatness and goodness to God can be summed up as “He is holy,” because holiness incorporates both greatness and goodness.” [^5]

[^5]: R.C. Sproul. Truths We Confess. 46.

It is the infinite, perfect greatness and goodness that God revealed to Isaiah and caused him to cry out, "Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips!" It is this holiness that cause the persecutor Saul declare Christ as Lord. It is this perfection that the heavenly beings continue to sing, "Holy, holy, holy."

It is this same holiness that caused the tax collector to stand in the back of the tabernacle, who would not dare lift his eyes towards heavens, but instead shout out, "Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner!"

It is this same holiness that keeps sons of Adam far from the presence of God.

It is this same holiness that marks the entire life of Jesus Christ. 

It is this same holiness that is now given to the people of God. All because God alone is holy.
