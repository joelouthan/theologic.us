## The Chapter

```text
The Lord our God is but one only living and true God; whose subsistence is in and of himself, infinite in being and perfection; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself; a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; who is immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, every way infinite, most holy, most wise, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will for his own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withal most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

## The Confession

This is loaded chapter. Because right out out the gate, after solidifying the confessions on the Scriptures, we go right into answering the question:

*Who is God?*

And the Historical Confessions (WCF, Savor, and 2LBC) front loads Chapter 2 on Theology with the attributes of God. Systematically speaking, it starts with the incommunicable attributes--the attributes that belong to God alone, while finishing it off with the communicable attributes of God--namely, those attributes that are shared with the imagebearers of God, that is, mankind. 

Another way of seeing these attributes organized is Richard Muller defined it. In *To the Judicious and Impartial Reader: Baptist Symbolics Volume 2*, Dr. Renihan attributes the following terms from Richard Muller's *Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms (2nd edition)*:

>>“*Archetypal theology* is “the infinite knowledge of God known only to God himself” while *ectypal theology* is “all true finite theology, defined as a reflection of the divine archetype.”
>>
>>Renihan. Baptist Symbolics Volume 2

To learn these attributes, we must examine them bit by bit and connect them with the appropriate declaration from Scripture.
