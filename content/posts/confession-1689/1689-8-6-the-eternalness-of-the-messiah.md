## The Text

>Revelation 1:8 (CSB) “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

## The Chapter

```text
Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by Christ till after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefit thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages, successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and sacrifices wherein he was revealed, and signified to be the seed which should bruise the serpent's head; and the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, being the same yesterday, and to-day and for ever.

## The Confession

### Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by Christ until after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefit thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages, successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and sacrifices wherein He was revealed, and signified to be the seed which should bruise the serpent's head

>1 Corinthians 4:10 (CSB) We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!

>Hebrews 4:2 (CSB) For we also have received the good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith.

>1 Peter 1:10–11 (CSB) Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that would come to you, searched and carefully investigated. They inquired into what time or what circumstances the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified in advance to the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.

You must consider all that is God!

Our Lord who does not change from the outside in and the inside out:

>Malachi 3:6 (CSB) “Because I, the LORD, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.

Our Lord who is all wise and all knowing and therefore is incapable of learning or discovering anything additional because he knows all things. For:

>Isaiah 40:13–14 (CSB) Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or who gave him counsel? Who did he consult? Who gave him understanding and taught him the paths of justice? Who taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding?

And Triune God--Father, Spirit, and the Son--do not and have not changed. For:

>James 1:17 (CSB) Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.

And each person of the Godhead have always been spirit. For:

>John 4:24 (CSB) God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and in truth.”

>Deuteronomy 4:15–16 (CSB) “Diligently watch yourselves—because you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb—so you don’t act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form,

Now why I am driving this.

Because the Son is God, spirit, eternal, and does not change, we have firmly established that while Christ did not accomplish his mission of saving his people from their sins until he died on the cross, because of all of who God is, the Son was able to communicate the virtue, efficacy, and benefit of his work to the elect in all ages. For:

>Hebrews 1:1 (CSB) Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways.

And in that, because everything that God promises will absolutely come to past:

>2 Corinthians 1:20 (CSB) For every one of God’s promises is “Yes” in him. Therefore, through him we also say “Amen” to the glory of God.

The salvation of Christ was going to happen whether we believe him or not. God does not operate within our confines and our limitations and our reality. He is far above our sins and our gods.

### and the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world

>Revelation 13:8 (CSB) All those who live on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name was not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.

>Ephesians 1:4 (ESV) even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.

It is because God is absolute that before the foundations of the world were in place--before Genesis 1:1--Christ was slain. For:

>John 17:24 (CSB) “Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they will see my glory, which you have given me because you loved me before the world’s foundation.

Because of the Father and Son promised, we were saved. 

Yes! Despite our fall. Despite our wickedness and our sin and out trespass and our iniquities. On our worst and best days. When we think we do good but for impure reasons. And we think we have pure reasons, and have fooled ourselves. When we respond in bitterness, gossip, anger, and lust because we have deceived ourselves that we are gods of our little worlds of sand--but we're the ones made from dust?

And when the fiery darts and lies and accusations and truths and temptations of the enemy and the world finds our flesh and sinks deep into our being and as the sizzling aroma of our skin reaches our nostrils and our minds, we change our minds and flee in desperation away from the only one who is good.

Despite all of that, we were saved.

### being the same yesterday, and today and for ever

>Hebrews 13:8 (CSB) Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

Because God alone is eternally absolute and love and wise and holy and merciful and gracious.

Because he saw our desperate state and rescued us from hell.

And he decided before the moment we could have sinned.

He alone is God.
