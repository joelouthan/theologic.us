<pre><blockquote>
  Though here I love him but little,
    may this be my portion at last.
  In this world thou hast given me a beginning,
    one day it will be perfected in the realm above.
  Thou hast helped me to see and know Christ,
    though obscurely,
    to take him, receive him,
    to possess him, love him,
    to bless him in my heart, mouth, life.
</blockquote></pre>

&#8211; from _Christ Alone_
