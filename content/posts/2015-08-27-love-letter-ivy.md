Ivy, my sweetest and most precious girl,

I could not begin to tell you what we were going through when we heard about you: death of my father, my grandmother, your Momma&#8217;s grandfather, and the passing away of your sister, Olivia.

These storms and the pains that we were going through in our own heart and souls tested the mettle of your Momma and Papa&#8217;s marriage and relationship and shook the foundation of our family to the bedrock.

Before we knew of you, it was dark. Joy was fought for and sometimes never won.

By announcing you, God reminded us that He is not far yet closer than a whisper. He promises hold infinitely true: eternal past, present and for the eternal future. He revealed that He has infinite mercy for us. He put on the most powerful display that we are indeed His kids and He is our Father in heaven. [<sup>1</sup>][1]{#return-note-2969-1.simple-footnote}

He sustained us through your first three months in Momma&#8217;s tummy when we were so anxious about you making it since it wasn&#8217;t even a year ago that we lost your sister during the same trimester.

But even through the first half of you growing in the womb, your Momma never fell ill. Never got sick. Never got weak. With all of your brothers and sisters, well, it was a different story. We thought for sure your Mom would be too sick to even get out of bed or keep any food or water down. Nope. She was alive, happy, and strong. God is so good He heals and restores.

Not only does He heals and restores the body but He went to work on my soul and our relationship. He began the work to heal my mind, heart, and soul and did the same for your Mom. In that, he gave confidence and peace to our family when there was none before.

And just like your brother, Eli, you were strong. Kicky and squirmy. And just like your Bubba, you stayed in your Mom weeks past what we thought was your due date. Smh. That might have been a mere indication—maybe even a prophecy—that you two were to be as thick as thieves. And by the Bub&#8217;s sweetness on you, I say that indication is coming to past.

But no matter how late you were, we knew that you couldn&#8217;t stay in your Mom&#8217;s tummy forever :) We knew you would get here. We knew we would be holding you soon.

And just like the pregnancy, your arrival was just as sweet. You woke us up at 3 am. It was time. Calls to your midwife, Lynette, were made. Texts to our family and friends were sent. Your Ganna, Amanda Panda, and Alisa Pizza were on their way to help with everything.

Unlike the Bubs, we were able to take our time preparing our room for your arrival. No rush. No fuss. Breakfast made. Coffee poured. Siblings chilling.

And then you arrived. I was so ready to catch you just like I did before with Eli but your Momma didn&#8217;t want me to leave her side.

Besides, Lynette was a pro. You were going to be in great hands until you could get to your Momma.

The moment you arrived: it was all the joy. The happiness. The sweet relief. The bliss. It was everything I could ever feel in one moment in time. I felt like cheering and yelling to celebrate your life and everything that the Lord has done in us and for us.

And I couldn&#8217;t stop smiling. My cheeks hurt because my grin was ear to ear.

Unlike your brother&#8217;s arrival, which was fast and furious, yours was what at one time what I called, &#8220;normal&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not it. Looking back, your birth was just like everything else your announcement brought: peace, calm, and joy.

In the midst of an incredible storm in our lives, God sends you here. You are God&#8217;s peace and restoration for our family. You are my prettiest and a joyful reminder that God is so mindful of me and He loves me so much.

That&#8217;s why I kiss you with my very prickly lips a hundred times a day. That is why I dive my nose into your neck smelling your sweet baby smells. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t want our conversations to end. You are the best reminder of who God is and what he has done for us.

I love you, my most gorgeous girl. You are my sweetest. My sweetest sweet. My Happiest Girl. My yin to Bub&#8217;s yang.

I will always love you. I will always protect you. I will be there to make you laugh and hold you tight when you cry. And I will fight for you, and us, and we, and me until my very last breath.

Love for life,

Papa
