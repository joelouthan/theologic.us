## MINISTRY VISION

Seeking to glorify Christ by serving his Bride, first and foremost, by preaching and teaching his word. My desire is to serve your church as an Interim Pastor in a bi-vocational capacity. I do this by faithfully preaching Christ crucified, teaching the Scriptures, and under-shepherd your congregation until God provides you with your next pastor.

## THE GOSPEL of CHRIST

The gospel is the good news that God looked upon me as a wicked, depraved, weak sinner and sent his Son to live and die so that I might be truly alive and free by the power of his Spirit.[^1]

[^1]: Romans 5:9; 1 John 5:1, Romans 8:14-17

For the gospel is the power of God in salvation for those who believe–to the Jew first and also the Greek. In this gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “the righteous shall live by faith.” [^2]

[^2]: Romans 1:16-17

This is the gospel of Christ that I must preach so that all may know the love of Christ for their souls, for, “faith comes by hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.”[^3] Simply put, we are saved by no name other than Jesus Christ. [^4]

[^3]: Romans 10:17
[^4]: Acts 4:12

## PERSONAL

Born on May 17, 1975, in Fort Worth, TX. Before being saved by God, I grew up in an abusive and broken home because of my father and stepmother. In addition, because of this brokenness, I have had a crippling pornography addiction since the age of 8 and never sought help. The tragedy of it all: despite repeating the sinner’s prayer, I was never repentant of my sins.

But God alone is good. When I was 32 years old, he snatched my heart up and called me his own. At that moment, I repented of all of my sins and trust in Christ alone.  So whatever God had in store, all I know is that I would serve and worship him for all of my days. In his great mercy and grace, God not only delivered me from my porn addiction but my life continues to produce the fruit of his Spirit within because my Father continuously conforms me to the image of his Son. [^5]

[^5]: Galatians 5:22-23; Romans 8:29 

My home is in Versailles, KY with my wife, Sarah, and our two kids, Elijah, and Ivy. Also, my in-laws live with us, Cherri and Jason. My oldest son, Yusef, lives in Norman, OK.
