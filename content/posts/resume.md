## Ministry Vision
Seeking to glorify Christ by serving his Bride by, first and foremost, preaching and teaching his word. My desire is to serve your church as an Interim Pastor in a bi-vocational capacity. I do this by faithfully preaching Christ crucified, teaching the Scriptures, and under-shepherd your congregation until God provides you with your next pastor.

## Personal Values

### ON GOD

He is the lover of my soul. My Beloved is mine, and I am his. (Songs 2:16) forever. The Spirit gives me new life in Christ and fills my soul (2 Corinthians 5:17-21, Romans 15:13); My Father and my Christ have made their home in me. (John 14:23)

He is my Lord and my God forever. And I love Him so much.

```text
No pen, no words, no image can express to you 
the loveliness of my only, only Lord Jesus. 

Samuel Rutherford
```

### ON THEOLOGY

My kids asked me once, “Papa, why do you have so many books on God?” To which I answered, “Most of the books on these shelves say the same thing over and over again, that, ‘Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so.’”

If God is the lover of my new heart, should I not know just how much He loves me? More so, I need to be reminded every day of His love for me because I tend to forget.

### ON SCRIPTURES

Sometime ago, I ran across an odd quote about the inerrancy and infallibility of the word of God by British theologian Lesslie Newbigin, who said (as I loosely quote), “Is the Bible without error and incapable of being wrong? That is asking the wrong question.” Modern thought asks the wrong question. Yet, Bible always trumps the philosophy of the age (Colossians 2:8-10) The correct question is, “Is the Bible perfect?”

How does the Bible answer that question?

```text
The instruction of the LORD is perfect,
  renewing one's life;
the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy,
  making the inexperienced wise.
The precepts of the LORD are right,
  making the heart glad;
the command of the LORD is radiant,
  making the eyes light up.
The fear of the LORD is pure,
  enduring forever;
the ordinances of the LORD are reliable
  and altogether righteous.
They are more desirable than gold —
  than an abundance of pure gold;
  and sweeter than honey
  dripping from a honeycomb.
In addition, your servant is warned by them,
  and in keeping them there is an abundant reward.

Psalms 19:7-11 (CSB)
```

When I was younger in the faith and perhaps a bit snarkier, I used to shockingly say, “I do not believe in the inerrancy and the infallibility of the Bible.” But the older I get and as I put my shock-jock days behind me, I simply quote Psalm 19 & 119, “The word of God is perfect.”

### ON THE GOSPEL

```text
In him thou hast given me so much
    that heaven can give no more.

Valley of Vision.
```

No imperatives to fulfill. No commands to follow. No law to disobey. No glory to fall way short.  Just the good news: God saves sinners. 

```text
"Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." 

Matthew 11:28-30 (CSB) 
```

And this is the gospel: the power of God in salvation for those who believe. For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed, from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith!” (Romans 1:16-17)

Do you see that? All by God. Nothing that we can bring. Yet, because God gave us his Son, we now have everything. (Romans 8:14-39; Hebrews 1:1-2)

```text
I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.

Ezekiel 36:25-28 (CSB)
```

If God has given you his own heart and placed His Spirit in you, it is only now that you are free and able to obey God.

```text
For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God's gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Ephesians 2:8-10 (CSB)
```

Now, as those saved by God, we have imperatives to fulfill. Because we are the children of God, we have commands to follow. Because Christ is our Lord and our God, we get to obey His law. For Christ’s works are your own. Christ’s life is your own. Christ’s life is yours! We have been justified, we are glorified! (Romans 8:30)

The gospel is the good news that God looked upon me as a wicked, depraved, weak sinner and sent his Son to live and die so that I might be truly alive and free by the power of his Spirit. (Romans 5:9; 1 John 5:1, Romans 8:14-17)

This is the gospel of Christ that I must preach so that all may know the love of Christ for their souls. Simply put, we are saved by no name other than Jesus Christ. (Acts 4:12)

## Ministry Philosophy

### ON PREACHING

For anyone to believe the gospel of Christ is not based on nor dependent on the intellect, emotions, personality types, the bent of the will, the state of the heart but completely on the supernatural grace and mercies of the Almighty God. (John 1:12-13) For:

```text
So faith comes from what is heard,  and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

Romans 10:17 (CSB) 
```

and:

```text
… so my word that comes from my mouth
will not return to me empty,
but it will accomplish what I please
and will prosper in what I send it to do."

Isaiah 55:11 (CSB) 
```

As a Christian, I can minister in all the ways. But I am specifically charged with one thing in life:

```text
I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom:

Preach the word;

be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 

2 Timothy 4:1-5 (CSB) 
```

### ON THE PASTORAL & COUNSELING

Because I have the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelling in me (Romans 8:11), I get to depend on the Holy Spirit to minister to others. Like all Christians, I get to lift up others, encourage them, and continuously point them back to the gospel of Christ and his perfect word.
 
To that end, when I am ministering to a person who has been through trauma and when it is evident they need more healing and help, I will not foolishly claim to be an expert. If they are willing, I will gladly help them find a licensed therapist who counsels and cares from a Christian worldview and who is trauma-informed.
 
I have Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because I have endured childhood abuse. Therefore, I take trauma seriously. Please know that I handle those who have gone through trauma with the gentlest care, for if I love the Lord my Christ, then I am to feed, card, and shepherd his sheep. (John 21:15-17)

I can minister to others because of Christ. We do live in a post-Genesis 3 world where everything is broken at the core and there seems to be no end to the destruction of sin. Yet, Christ is our Redeemer and Savior. He is the only God that heals because his grace is more.

```text
No pit is so deep that He is not deeper still; with Jesus even in our darkest moments, the best remains and the very best is yet to be.

Corrie Ten Boom
```

### ON ACCOUNTABILITY

Before knowing Christ, I lived a life that was emotionally alone and did not want people to know my real heart for it was terribly wicked. When I was saved by Christ, I had to fight to make sure I am truly known by those whom I love and who love me.
 
I have many friends I turn to (see References) in times of trouble. But, as you can see, most of them are out of state. Since moving to Kentucky, I pray to God to provide new friends and a new community. Joyfully, I see, in his steadfast love, continuously increasing His people around me. God will provide. He always does.

## Personal History

I know this little old lady. Lived to about 88 years old. Love the Lord her God. Was blessed with a husband, three boys, and adopted a little girl. This little lady prayed every day and every night that God would save her family.

Her husband lost his good sense and ran away with some other woman. This lady promptly drove to Phoenix in their family station wagon, picked his sorry butt up, and brought him home. A few months later was diagnosed with prostate cancer and passed away after that diagnosis pretty quickly.

The little old lady continued to pray.

Their youngest son was the worst kind of human being. Porn absolutely wrecked his life. So much so, that he sexually abused his own children, got caught, and then got sent to prison for about 400 years before he died in prison.

The little old lady continued to pray.

While we thank God that the little old lady’s grandson did not abuse any children, he certainly did his fair share of his own sexual immorality. Her grandson was introduced to porn at the age of 8. And it had gripped his heart for all of his life. His addiction became so crippling that he went to go work in the porn industry just as the internet was coming online. Websites, servers, photos, videos, recruiting--whatever it took in order to feed his wicked heart.

Yet, the little old lady continued to pray.

How did God respond to this little old lady who prayed every morning and every night for over half a century?

After yanking her husband back from Phoenix, her husband came to know Christ and repent of all his sins. Shortly thereafter, around 42 years old, he died from cancer and went to be with the Lord.

Her son, who was rotting away in prison, wasn't saved by Christ until he was 56--twenty some odd years after being in prison. God gripped his heart so hard, that he gave up what little he had to be with God. Even his supposed future freedom. When he was finally up for parole, he declined. When the board asked him why, he simply stated, "There are many men in this place who are in darkness. I have the light of God in me. If I leave, who will show them the light of Christ? Therefore, I have to stay." He continued to do ministry for a few more years until he went to be with the Lord.

Her grandson, who foolishly thought he was saved from damnation and death just because he had said a sinner's prayer when he was 8 years old. Never mind the fact that by the time he was 25 years old, he was dealing in so much porn and living the most depraved, immoral life with absolutely no repentance of his sins and no love nor fear of God. But then, right before his 32nd birthday, God snatched this man's heart and gave him His own heart. At that moment, this man laid everything down and repented before God. And he loved the Lord his God. Did the young man's life suddenly become awesome and easy? Nope. This man will undoubtedly be conformed to the image of His blessed Son for the rest of his saved life. (Romans 8:29) For this man knew he belonged to God and God belonged to him forever. 

This little old lady, by God's sweet grace, got to see each of her prayers answered before she went to be with God.

```text
I recall your sincere faith that first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and now, I am convinced, is in you also.

2 Timothy 1:5 (CSB) 
```

If this story sounds a little bit personal, that’s because it is. That little old lady is my grandma. Her name is Frances and her husband's name was Jack. 

Her youngest son in the story, who ended up dying while doing ministry in prison? His name is Joseph.

His oldest son, the grandson in the story? That is me. I am Joseph. I am the grandson that used to have a crippling porn addiction and had nothing but a jacked-up, messed-up life to show for it.

My grandma contended for our lives and our hearts to God. And each of us Louthan men went to the utter extremes of sin and depravity to find out that the world and sin had nothing to offer. My grandfather, my father, and I have sinned upon sin–way more than the average man. Yet, because Christ has come to save His people from their sins, my fathers and I have been given grace upon grace. (Matthew 1:21; John 1:16) Yet, I know for a fact that God is the mighty one who saves. (Zephaniah 3:17) 

God asks in Isaiah, "Is my arm too short to save anyone?" (Isaiah 50:2)

The answer is gloriously clear: you cannot out-sin the salvation of the Almighty God.
