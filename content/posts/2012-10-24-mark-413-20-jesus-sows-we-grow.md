How then will you understand all the parables?** 

 **The sower sows the word. And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.&#8221;**

1. _Can we grow to be like Jesus_? (Rom 8:28-30)

&nbsp;

2. _How do we grow to be like Jesus?_

&nbsp;

3. _According to the passage, how can we do what he does_? (Spread the word of God)

&nbsp;

4. _When you tell everybody about Jesus, will everybody believe automatically_?

&nbsp;

5. _When you plant a seed into the ground, does it grow automatically or slowly_?

&nbsp;

6. _Even if everyone does not believe automatically, does that mean we have to stop telling people about Jesus_?

So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers. You are God&#8217;s field, God&#8217;s building.**

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
