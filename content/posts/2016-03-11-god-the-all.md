<pre><blockquote>
  I know that thou art the author and finisher of faith,
  that the whole work of redemption is thine alone,
  that every good work or thought found in me
  is the effect of thy power and grace,
  that thy sole motive in working in me to will
  and to do is for thy good pleasure.
</blockquote></pre>
