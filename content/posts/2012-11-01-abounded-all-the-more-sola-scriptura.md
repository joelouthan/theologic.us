2 Timothy 3:16-4:5
  
**All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.**

**I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.**

John 1:1-5; 14-18
  
**In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.**

**And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.**

Genesis 3:15
  
**I will put enmity between you and the woman,**
  
 **and between your offspring and her offspring;**
  
 **he shall bruise your head,**
  
 **and you shall bruise his heel.”**

Psalm 19:1-14
  
**The heavens declare the glory of God,**
  
 **and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.**
  
 **Day to day pours out speech,**
  
 **and night to night reveals knowledge.**
  
 **There is no speech, nor are there words,**
  
 **whose voice is not heard.**
  
 **Their voice goes out through all the earth,**
  
 **and their words to the end of the world.**
  
 **In them he has set a tent for the sun,**
  
 **which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,**
  
 **and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.**
  
 **Its rising is from the end of the heavens,**
  
 **and its circuit to the end of them,**
  
 **and there is nothing hidden from its heat.**

**The law of the Lord is perfect,**
  
 **reviving the soul;**
  
 **the testimony of the Lord is sure,**
  
 **making wise the simple;**
  
 **the precepts of the Lord are right,**
  
 **rejoicing the heart;**
  
 **the commandment of the Lord is pure,**
  
 **enlightening the eyes;**
  
 **the fear of the Lord is clean,**
  
 **enduring forever;**
  
 **the rules of the Lord are true,**
  
 **and righteous altogether.**
  
 **More to be desired are they than gold,**
  
 **even much fine gold;**
  
 **sweeter also than honey**
  
 **and drippings of the honeycomb.**
  
 **Moreover, by them is your servant warned;**
  
 **in keeping them there is great reward.**

**Who can discern his errors?**
  
 **Declare me innocent from hidden faults.**
  
 **Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;**
  
 **let them not have dominion over me!**
  
 **Then I shall be blameless,**
  
 **and innocent of great transgression.**

**Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart**
  
 **be acceptable in your sight,**
  
 **O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.**

Revelation 19:11-16
  
**Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.**

Luke 24:44-49 **Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”**
