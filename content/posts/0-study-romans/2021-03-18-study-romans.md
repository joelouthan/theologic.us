## The Text

>Romans 6:1–14 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
>
>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires. And do not offer any parts of it to sin as weapons for unrighteousness. But as those who are alive from the dead, offer yourselves to God, and all the parts of yourselves to God as weapons for righteousness. For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law but under grace.

## The Support

>Matthew 1:21–24 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”  Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:  See, the virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel, which is translated “God is with us.”  When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her

>Hebrews 9:27–28 (CSB) And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment— so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

## God

God buried our sin for good.

>Psalm 103:11–13 (CSB) For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his faithful love toward those who fear him.  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.  As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.

Or one of my favorite late 19th century English preacher once put it:

>>Now, by the sacrifice of Christ all the sins of the Church are entirely put away. He, the sinless Lamb of God, took them up and bore them away into a land of oblivion, whence even the Divine mind fails to recall them.
>>
>>- Octavius Winslow, No Condemnation in Christ Jesus.

What is God like in all of this?

Per John Stott, God is high above, far from, exposes, burns, and vomits out sin.  That means he does all of these things to my sin. In his holiness and righteousness, he has every right not only to reject me but to vomit me out and spit me out.  More so, he has the right to pour his wrath upon me. If the Son of God were to ever hunt me down, I rather to have a mountain be thrown on me than to face the Almighty God himself.

## The Gospel

But here is the good news: God did not do the sin. God does not do evil. Yet, God does not lie. God desires his people. Therefore, God does whatever it takes to save his people.

## Our Responsibility

Go and sin no more.

Kill off sin.

Repent. Kingdom of God is here.

That is all well and good. But if you actually been plagued by ongoing, the worst thing you can do is give up hope. No. The Bible tells us to trust in Jesus Christ. That is our hope. When we hope in him, that marks us as Christians. Not our works. Not what we say. But where we put our hope in when everything is good and everything has gone to crap.

Trust in the Lord.

Amen.
