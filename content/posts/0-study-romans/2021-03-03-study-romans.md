## The Text

>Romans 1:8–12 (CSB) First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world.  God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in telling the good news about his Son—that I constantly mention you, always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.  For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,  that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.

## The Support

The Great Commission, simplified:

>1 Thessalonians 2:8b (NIV) Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.

## God

God is worthy of all our praise and thanksgiving.

>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world.

God alone is our witness.

>Romans 8:16 (CSB) The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,

God empowers us for ministry.

>Ephesians 4:11-16 (CSB) And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness. Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head—Christ. From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.

>Ephesians 6:10 (CSB) Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.

## The Gospel

The gospel is about His Son, Jesus Christ.

>1 Corinthians 15:3-8 (CSB) For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me.

## Our Responsibility

Just as Paul is affectionately writing to the church in Rome, here is a reminder of what Christ says to us:

>John 13:34-35 (CSB) “I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

>1 John 3:16 (CSB) This is how we have come to know love: He laid down his life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.

1\. Pray that God will use you for his will

>that I constantly mention you, always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.

2\. Pray that God gives you spiritual gifts that hopes to build his church

>For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift

3\. Pray to build up one another

>to strengthen you,  that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.

```text
You have called on us
  to obey you
  to seek your face
  to follow you wherever you go
  to pick up our cross
  to exchange our sin
  for your righteousness
  to worship no other gods
  to worship you alone.

My God,
  give us Christ
  the strength of your Spirit
  to do your will.

Blessed be the glorious name of the Lord,

Amen.
