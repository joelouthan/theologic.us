## The Text

> Romans 6:15–23 (CSB) What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not!  Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of that one you obey—either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness?  But thank God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching to which you were handed over,  and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.  I am using a human analogy because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification.  For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.  So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? The outcome of those things is death.  But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life!  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## The Support

> Mark 5:1–20 (CSB) They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.  As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.  He lived in the tombs, and no one was able to restrain him anymore—not even with a chain— because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, but had torn the chains apart and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him.  Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains, he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
>
> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.  And he cried out with a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you before God, don’t torment me!”  For he had told him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”
>
> “What is your name?” he asked him. “My name is Legion,” he answered him, “because we are many.”  And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the region.
>
> A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside.  The demons begged him, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.”  So he gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned there.
>
> The men who tended them ran off and reported it in the town and the countryside, and people went to see what had happened.  They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.  Those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and told about the pigs.  Then they began to beg him to leave their region.  As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him earnestly that he might remain with him.  Jesus did not let him but told him, “Go home to your own people, and report to them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.”  So he went out and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.
>
> Romans 8:18–25 (CSB) For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.  For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed.  For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope  that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.  For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now.  Not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?  Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.

## God

> Isaiah 61:1 (CSB) The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners;

Who is that? That is Jesus Christ.

## The Gospel

We don't get to sin more because we are in bondage to sin. That is something we have to realize about unbelievers: the best that they can do is sin. Because they are not in Christ, everything they do is in sin.

Again and again, if you are hearing this and you thought to yourself, "I am not like unbelievers because I am a Christians because I went to church all of my life" or something else you did.  Trust me when I say this: you might be an unbeliever. You might be in shackles of sin and unbelief but you might behave a little better than the next person.

Just because you behave better does not make a believer.

I cannot do the work of the Holy Spirit. But there are people listening and reading this Bible Study who are entertaining sin and not really wanting to change their mind about it and definitely have no interested in changing their lives. They want to go to church, be a member, read the Bible, memorize verses, sing songs, volunteer in Kid's Ministry, even be on staff of church still thinking that they have done enough to be consider a Christian. And some sin doesn't lead to immediate death so the consequences are little. But some of you are playing with such sins that if you get caught, it will completely blow up your entire lives. But I think that you have convinced yourself when that happens, you are going to be really sorry, there might be tears, and you will try really hard.

And you will still be under the wrath of God for your unbelief in the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Our Responsibility

> Luke 18:9–17 (CSB) He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else:  “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  The Pharisee was standing and praying like this about himself: ‘God, I thank you that I’m not like other people—greedy, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.  I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get.’  “But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even raise his eyes to heaven but kept striking his chest and saying, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’  I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the other, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

Only one of them came away saved by God.

> 15-17 People were bringing infants to him so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  Jesus, however, invited them: “Let the little children come to me, and don’t stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

I have no idea of where your faith is at. But if you have a tiny bit of faith, you will always have the wide open arms of a Savior who is always there waiting to love you forever.

Stop overthinking it. Stop overdoing it. Just run to God. Call upon the name of Jesus Christ and be saved this moment.
