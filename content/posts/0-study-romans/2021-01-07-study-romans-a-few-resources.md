## It Goes Without Say

Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over.

If I had to pick just one, I use it way more in my [Olive Tree Study Bible](https://www.olivetree.com) than anything else.

## Personal

[Here is Love: Exposition on Romans 8](/tags/here-is-love/) This is the work that really started it all. And by all I mean, all of reading, writing, studying, teaching, and preaching. I worked on this from 2012 to 2018.  I cannot begin to tell you the agonizing and cripplingly darkness I went through while writing this book. At the end, it ended up being my worshipful testimony of the heights and depths of the beauty of God's grace alone.  Even outside of Romans 8 in the Bible, I will unashamedly often refer to Romans 8. Why? Romans 8 is contains the entire gospel.

You can certainly do worse than to memorize it, write songs about it, and even write books about it.  There are too many rightful references to Romans 8 being Mount Everest of any chapter in the Bible.  Martin Luther called it, "The clearest gospel of all."

___

[Commentary: Romans](/tags/commentary-romans/) Although I have not gotten as far as Romans 1:18-20, it was that work that inspired this Bible Study.  When I am finished with writing this Bible Study, I hope and pray that it will drive me to finish that commentary.

As Unfolded in the Eighth Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans  
by Octavius Winslow  
1853, Banner of Trust

I love this book so much that I purchase an 1st edition 1853 print of this book.

If I had one book to gift outside the Bible, it would be this. If I had one word to describe it: fantastic.

If I was forced at gunpoint to choose one commentary for Romans, this would be the one I would keep. Hands down. Not even a second thought. I have read this from cover to cover. Highest recommendation. A better suggestion: stop reading my drivel and buy this book. Seriously. Go.

by Douglas Moo  
1996, Eerdmans.  

I only mentioned the first edition because the second edition came out in 2020 and I haven't gotten my hands on it. This is a standard, el-defacto technical commentary reco for Romans. It's so highly recommended across all denominations and Protestant theological convictions, it's almost a generalization. But refer to it just once and you know that it is a generalization because it is true.

Said it before and I will say it again: Billy H. is my boy for no other reason he tried to buck the Dispensationalism trends going on in Evangelicalism.

Craziest thing, tho. I have several others in his NT set but for some reason, I didn't have his Romans. Had to scoop this off e-Bay.

I think this entire series is an excellent resource to have on hand if you can pony up the scratch.  It's all fine and good to read guys from within the last few centuries. But how about reading commentary from within the first few centuries after the ascension of Christ. You ain't going to read anything shockingly new.  But what you are going realize there is absolutely nothing new under the sun and Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention Luther's commentary. It was his desperate mediation on one little famous Habakkukan quote that literally and figuratively hammers the change within the Church and help begun the Protestant Reformation: **THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH!**
