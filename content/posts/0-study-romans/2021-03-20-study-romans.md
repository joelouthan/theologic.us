## The Text

> Romans 7:1–6 (CSB) Since I am speaking to those who know the law, brothers and sisters, don’t you know that the law rules over someone as long as he lives?  For example, a married woman is legally bound to her husband while he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law regarding the husband.  So then, if she is married to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then, if she is married to another man, she is not an adulteress.  Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another. You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.  For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused through the law were working in us to bear fruit for death.  But now we have been released from the law, since we have died to what held us, so that we may serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the old letter of the law.

## The Support

> Mark 10:1–12 (CSB) He set out from there and went to the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Then crowds converged on him again, and as was his custom he taught them again.  Some Pharisees came to test him, asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”  He replied to them, “What did Moses command you?”  They said, “Moses permitted us to write divorce papers and send her away.”  But Jesus told them, “He wrote this command for you because of the hardness of your hearts.  But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.  For this reason a man will leave his father and mother  and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.  Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”  When they were in the house again, the disciples questioned him about this matter.  He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.  Also, if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”

## God

Marriage was never about us. From Genesis 2, when God created Adam & Eve, he meant as a reflection of covenant between God and his people. That relationship was perfect because God is perfect and everything that he does is good.

When sin entered into Creation, everything was broken include our relationship with God. The effects of sin rolled outward. By God's grace, we still get to marry but because of sin, divorce happens.

Why? Look at what Christ says, "Divorce was permitted because the hardness of your heart."

If you think the point of this study or the Bible is to stay married and never divorce, you are wrong. The point of the Bible is that God is good, Jesus came to save, sin breaks everything and our hearts are hardened because of our sin.

## The Gospel

> Ezekiel 36:25–27 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.  I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.

God literally has to exchange our wicked, sinful, lustful, treasonous, idolatry-making, hardened heart with his gently, lowly, tender, soft, steadfast loving heart.

## Our Responsibility

If one spouse dies, the other is no longer bounded in marriage.

If your sin is dead and buried by Christ alone, we are no longer bounded in sin. We are no longer prisoners. We are not in a cell of sin. We are affected by sin. We are certainly not identified by sin--even if the world tries to redefine sin, you are not bound to it.

What's ours to do? Repent of sin. Confess to one another. Run back to God and dump your sin on him. His Son literally purchased your sin so you wouldn't be crushed under the weight of it.  Give him your sin. Right now.

If you wake up tomorrow and sin, give it to him again. If you are in Christ, he has given you a new heart ot love, a renewed mind to think, his Spirit whom empowers us to actual life--you get to give your sin over. You are not in bondage like unbelievers. So give your sin to God. Right now.
