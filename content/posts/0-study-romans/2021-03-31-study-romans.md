## The Text

> Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

## The Support

### Abraham

> Genesis 12:1-3 (CSB)  
> The LORD said to Abram:  
> Go from your land,  
> your relatives,  
> and your father’s house  
> to the land that I will show you.  
> I will make you into a great nation,  
> I will bless you,  
> I will make your name great,  
> and you will be a blessing.  
> I will bless those who bless you,  
> I will curse anyone who treats you with contempt,  
> and all the peoples on earth  
> will be blessed through you.

### Isaac

> Genesis 17:19 (ESV) God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.

### Jacob

> Genesis 32:24-29 (CSB) Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he could not defeat him, he struck Jacob’s hip socket as they wrestled and dislocated his hip. Then he said to Jacob, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
>
> But Jacob said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
>
> “What is your name?” the man asked.  
> “Jacob,” he replied.
>
> “Your name will no longer be Jacob,” he said. “It will be Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.”
>
> Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”  
> But he answered, “Why do you ask my name?” And he blessed him there.

### Joseph

> Genesis 41:37-45 (CSB) The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants, and he said to them, “Can we find anyone like this, a man who has God’s spirit in him?” So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you are. You will be over my house, and all my people will obey your commands. Only I, as king, will be greater than you.” Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “See, I am placing you over all the land of Egypt.” Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck. He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, and servants called out before him, “Make way!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt. Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh and no one will be able to raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt without your permission.” Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him a wife, Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.

## Our God

> Psalms 90 (CSB)  
> Lord, you have been our refuge  
> in every generation.  
> Before the mountains were born,  
> before you gave birth to the earth and the world,  
> from eternity to eternity, you are God.  
> You return mankind to the dust,  
> saying, “Return, descendants of Adam.”  
> For in your sight a thousand years  
> are like yesterday that passes by,  
> like a few hours of the night.  
> You end their lives; they sleep.  
> They are like grass that grows in the morning—  
> in the morning it sprouts and grows;  
> by evening it withers and dries up.  
> For we are consumed by your anger;  
> we are terrified by your wrath.  
> You have set our iniquities before you,  
> our secret sins in the light of your presence.  
> For all our days ebb away under your wrath;  
> we end our years like a sigh.  
> Our lives last seventy years  
> or, if we are strong, eighty years.  
> Even the best of them are struggle and sorrow;  
> indeed, they pass quickly and we fly away.  
> Who understands the power of your anger?  
> Your wrath matches the fear that is due you.  
> Teach us to number our days carefully  
> so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts.  
> LORD—how long?  
> Turn and have compassion on your servants.  
> Satisfy us in the morning with your faithful love  
> so that we may shout with joy and be glad all our days.  
> Make us rejoice for as many days as you have humbled us,  
> for as many years as we have seen adversity.  
> Let your work be seen by your servants,  
> and your splendor by their children.  
> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us;  
> establish for us the work of our hands—  
> establish the work of our hands!

## The Gospel

> Ephesians 1:3-14 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.
>
> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding. He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ as a plan for the right time—to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.
>
> In him we have also received an inheritance, because we were predestined according to the plan of the one who works out everything in agreement with the purpose of his will, so that we who had already put our hope in Christ might bring praise to his glory.
>
> In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.

> Ephesians 2:1-10 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift— not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

> John 1:12-13 (CSB) But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

> 1 John 5:1 (CSB) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him.

> John 10:27-30 (CSB) My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

> John 12:32 (CSB) As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.”

## Our Responsibility

The Puritans have called verse 30, "The Golden Chain of Salvation." It is what God uses to save his people back to himself.

What is ours to do? Grab hold of the chain that pertains to you!

Not predestination! You have done nothing to attract the attention of God.

Not calling! We are Lazarus! We are dead in our trespasses. And we need the Living God who has called everything into existence to call to us to life!

Not justification! It is while were not good, not righteous, but wicked sinners deserving of all his wrath, Christ died for us! Because of his great love!

Certainly not glorification! Who else but by the power and might and grace and sovereignty of God can lift the dead corpse not only unto the truly alive, but the fullness of joy, endless pleasures, and perfect satisfaction forevermore!

Ours to do is to obey the Lord Jesus Christ only by the power of the Spirit: repent of you sins and give your sins over to God!
