## The Text

**Romans 1:8–12 (CSB) First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world.  God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in telling the good news about his Son—that I constantly mention you, always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.  For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,  that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.**

## The Support

The Great Commission, expressed eloquently and succinctly in this one verse:

**1 Thessalonians 2:8b (NIV) Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.**

## God

### The salvation of God is not measured in theocracy over his people but rather in the outpouring of the heart of those believe and trust in Him

What do I mean by theocracy? Simply put, it is when the law of a religion is now made the law of the land. Now for some of you, that sounds amazing. Be honest. What if we could just get everybody to follow the law of God and then we would be a holy nation and we would please God and God would bless us. Make no mistake, when we obey God, we do please God and from that obedience, there are blessings--mostly surrounding being saved by God and knowing who God is and loving him.  But also, please grasp this absolute truth: you cannot start to obey God until you are saved by God. And you are not saved by God until God takes out your wicked, sin-filled, granite-like heart and replaces it with His own tender, soft heart:

**Ezekiel 36:25–27 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.  I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.**

Let us say, we can take all the laws of God and institutionalize them as the laws of the land. And let us say we we have the best way of enforcing those laws, isn't that what God wants?

First, no. We have one authoritative text that tells us that is impossible and that text is the word of God. All of your hopes and dreams of having God's laws as the laws of the land are dashed into pieces once you start reading the Bible. We see our first parents, Adam and Eve, sinned wickedly and ashamedly in the eyes of God by how? Disobeying the one commandment of God. There wasn't even a commandment, "Love the Lord your God". He just kept it clear, "Don't eat from this tree, for sure you will die." Adam and Eve disobeyed and now we are all born into sin. And then God sets up more and more laws to reflect who He is, who we are, and just how far we are from him.  When we see that we are infinitely far from Him and there is nothing we can do to save ourselves, we have to trust the same God, whom came down in the midst of our first parents first sin, and preached the first instance of the Gospel where He will send His Son, into the midst of the sin of the world and will defeat the Accuser and save His people from their sins forever. 

Second, not only we see it as impossibility with man to do anything to be saved and blessed by God, pure obedience is what is required by God but it is not His utmost desired:

Matthew 9:9–13 (CSB) As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me,” and he got up and followed him.  While he was reclining at the table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came to eat with Jesus and his disciples.  When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”  Now when he heard this, he said, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick.  Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

In other words, yes, God does require obedience. But you and me lack the power to actually obey God out of a pure heart.

Put in a other way:

Romans 8:3–4 (CSB) For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering,  in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

and

2 Corinthians 5:21 (CSB) He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

## The Gospel

What is the Good News in all of this?

God requires you to obey Him perfectly. But here is the straight fact: God knew you were going to fail. He knew this. He knew that no matter how easy or thorough he would make his law, he saw that "all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."[^1]

He saw you, in your sin, treason, wickedness, and hatred, just like Noah in the middle of the wickedness of mankind, gave you grace and kindness and love.

Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

And that love and grace can only be found in Christ Jesus.

## Our Responsibility

Our responsibility in all of this?

Trust in the Living God. Do that and then go and sin no more.[^2]
