## The Text

>Romans 8:32 (CSB) He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything?

## The Support

>Psalms 23:1 (CSB) The LORD is my shepherd;  
>I have what I need.

>Romans 8:16-17 (CSB) The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

>Matthew 6:25-34 (CSB) “Therefore I tell you: Don’t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they? Can any of you add one moment to his life span by worrying? And why do you worry about clothes? Observe how the wildflowers of the field grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these. If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won’t he do much more for you—you of little faith? So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

>Matthew 5:43-48 (CSB) “You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what are you doing out of the ordinary? Don’t even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

>2 Corinthians 5:21 (CSB) He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

## God

God is our provider.

In order for you to get to God, God is going to have to provide everything for you so that you can run to him and be with him.

God is infinite. Also, he is infinitely far away from our sins.

`Where do you see God in the text? What does the text say about God?`

## The Gospel

We cannot hope to do, say, or promise anything of our own that can bridge the gap between us and God. If God was a straight line from us and we took one step towards him, we would not be closer. Not at all. Just like in the Tower of Babel, we think we are getting closer to God but honestly, we are filling ourselves with our self-righteousness. And what does that do? Increase our guilt in the sight of the Holy God.

If the distance between us and God is infinite and we are finite, in order to close that gap, something infinite must step into the gap.

Someone greater already did. His name is Jesus Christ.

Here is the thing that is going to blow your mind.

Piece together these two passages:

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,
>and between your offspring and her offspring.
>He will strike your head,
>and you will strike his heel.

>Romans 3:23-26 (CSB) For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

Because God does not lie, all of his promises are yes and amen, and whatever promises he makes, he absolutely keeps, then the moment he appeared to Adam and Eve and preached the good news that Christ was coming to be born as ain 

## Our Responsibility

1\. **Find the promises that God actually made** - You do this by reading his word.

I cannot tell you how many Christians I have heard say, "I believe this is a promise of God" because some well-intentioned other Christian said so. But that word is cannot be found in the Bible.

You know what is the most encouraging thing in the world is? When the truth is proclaim and it is done so with gentleness and humility. God did it this way. Christ did it this way. The Spirit does it this way. We should do it this way.

2\. **Believe in what he has said** - How do we know we believe what God has said?

>Romans 1:16-17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: **The righteous will live by faith**.

>Romans 8:24-25 (CSB) Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.

## Pray

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Source of All Truth
</div>
&nbsp;

Give us  
  your Spirit  
  so that our eyes will be open  
  our ears to hear  
  our heart soften  
  our minds renew  
  so that we can see your truth and beauty  
  and behold it for ourselves.

Amen.
