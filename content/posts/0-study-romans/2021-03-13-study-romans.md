## The Text

> Romans 4:6–12 (CSB) Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
>
> Blessed are those whose lawless acts are forgiven  
> and whose sins are covered.  
> Blessed is the person  
> the Lord will never charge with sin.  
>
> Is this blessing only for the circumcised, then? Or is it also for the uncircumcised? For we say, Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness. In what way, then, was it credited—while he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? It was not while he was circumcised, but uncircumcised. And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while still uncircumcised. This was to make him the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, so that righteousness may be credited to them also. And he became the father of the circumcised, who are not only circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.

## The Support

> Romans 3:21–26 (CSB) But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

> Jeremiah 9:25–26 (CSB) “ ‘Look, the days are coming—this is the LORD’s declaration—when I will punish all the circumcised yet uncircumcised: Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair on their temples. All these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.’ ”

## God

God has consistently never been satisfied with the bare minimum. Just something you can do once and be done with Him.

> Genesis 17:11 (CSB) You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.

> Jeremiah 4:4 (CSB)  
> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD;  
> remove the foreskin of your hearts,  
> men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem.  
> Otherwise, my wrath will break out like fire  
> and burn with no one to extinguish it  
> because of your evil deeds.  

## The Gospel

> Deuteronomy 30:6 (CSB) The LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love him with all your heart and all your soul so that you will live.

How?

> > Ezekiel 36:25–27 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.

Or to sum it up in another way:

> Ephesians 2:8–10 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

## Our Responsibility

We tend to point to something in our past and say, "Look, look! I did this on this day. That means I am saved." Said a prayer. Got baptized. Filled with the Spirit. Went to church. My parents are Christian. I've worked in ministry for some odd years.

I will never forget this particular Bible teacher's response when one of his students and came up and asked him, "Excuse me, sir, are you a Christian?"

To which the teacher responded with, "You tell me."

What would people who *actually* know you say about you? In other words, do you keep pointing to this event back in the past to convince yourself that you are saved? Or can you point to God's grace today that you are not like you were yesterday or the month before or the day before?

Listen, this is what we know of God and his people:

- God disciplines his kids
- God conforms his kids to look his only begotten Son
- His steadfast love never ceases
- He gives grace upon grace
- His mercies are new every morning

You cannot save yourself. Only God saves. Your and my responsiblity? Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ every time you get up in the morning all the way until you go back to sleep. Yes, we are not going to do it perfect. In fact, when we try to obey him perfectly we are actually sinning--not unless we have trusted Christ with our whole heart and all of our sin. Only right then can you obey him.
