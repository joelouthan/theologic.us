## The Text

> Romans 3:27–4:5 (CSB) Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By one of works? No, on the contrary, by a law of faith. For we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
>
> What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about—but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness. Now to the one who works, pay is not credited as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness.

## The Support

>       Isaiah 42:8 (CSB)
>       I am the LORD. That is my name,
>       and I will not give my glory to another
>       or my praise to idols.

> Matthew 23:3-4 (CSB) Therefore do whatever they tell you, and observe it. But don’t do what they do, because they don’t practice what they teach. They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry and put them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them.

## God

God will not be placed into our debt. I don't know of a fancy theologically term for this.

I just know that so many people try to score a deal with God: "if I do this think for you, then you should do this thing for me." I have heard it gone as far as, "Do this thing for me and I will do this thing for you."

Now, for those of us who have read the Bible, we might suggest, "Didn't Gideon do this exact thing?"

Here's the thing: Gideon believed and it was counted to him as righteousness. He was in right standing with God

Many of you are trying to bargain with the Almighty God of the Universe and yet you do not believe.  God does not deal with the wicked.

And still many of you believe at a young age thinking if you did all the right things, that God would bless you. Most of you all are now just figuring that out that it doesn't work. It doesn't work because self-righteousness, witchcraft, and idolatry.

God is not a little god to be bargain with.

## The Gospel

Maybe you are guilty of this. You know when will be a good time to repent of this?

The best time would have been years ago.

The second best time would be right this second. Listen, you might try to hold on and thinking you can still get God to give you favor if you can do more and more stuff. That is the opposite of repentance. And the Bible makes it clear that repentance doesn't come from within us (because nothing is good within us) but yet, it is a gift from God.

> Acts 11:18 (ESV): 18 When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.”

> 2 Timothy 2:24–25 (CSB) The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient, instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth.

> Romans 2:4 (ESV): Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?

## Our Responsibility

> Mark 1:14–15 (ESV): Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, 15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

Most religions suggest that you repent. God demands that in order for you to trust and believe in Him, you must repent.

What is repentance? Changing the way you live that you bear witness that you worship the Living God.

Let me ask you this: are you busy repenting of sin when you see your sin clearly exposed by the word of God? Or when the word of God is before you exposing your sin, you are too busy trying to do Bible gymnastics so that your sin is not a sin?

Or like most of us: just don't read the Bible and that solves that problem.

If you are in sin and refusing to repent of it, and we all know that God gives the gift of repentance to all those who trust and obey, why hasn't He given you this gift?  Do you even dare to ask for this gift of repentance so that you can repent and change your life and believe in God and live in God?

Do you dare?

Repent for the kingdom of God is here.
