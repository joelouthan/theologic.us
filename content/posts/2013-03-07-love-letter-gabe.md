You know what I love about you? You are completely different compared to your other siblings. You are nothing like your brothers and sisters. Heck, you are nothing like any person I have ever met.

First and foremost, you are marked with intense amount of passion. For art and singing, I could talk on end about that but that is not what I am talking about. What I do know, see and feel every single day is your passion to love and to give love. It is amazing to see you develop the myriad of ways to love your siblings, your mom and even me.

You continuously endlessly play chase with Emma.

You instantaneously comfort Grace when she is hurt.

I love how you are the first to run in from another part of the house just to hug Yusef when he gets home.

I am privy to the hundreds of really late night chats with your big brother Griff.

Then you lovingly, tenderly, sweetly hold Elijah with all the love that a person could possibly hold.

You snuggle and cuddle with your Mom as tightly as you can.

You engage, talk, go deep, hug, and receive kisses from me.

You love us. You love each and every one of us. And you do so passionately.

Every time I see you love, I cannot help and be reminded on how much Jesus Christ each and every one of us. You know all of that passion and all of that love that you have in your heart and you just gotta get out? That comes from Jesus. You love like Jesus. Guess what? If you love like Jesus, just think how much more Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you more than you can possibly imagine. He will always there to heal any of your hurts. He is there when you have a crappy day. He always there to talk with you and hear what you have to say.

His love is infinitely there for you. He will always love you. He will never love you less. He cannot turn away from you. He cannot withhold his love from you.

I also love the way you can express yourself and your emotions. Truth be told, this thing that you so easily do—tell someone on how you feel and what is going on in your heart—is something that I don’t do really well. It was because of you and the example that you set inspired me to work on and grow in sharing what&#8217;s going on in my heart. You are one of the greatest examples that I have in seeing the incredible strength in a person and in a relationship that comes with being truly vulnerable with one another. Every time I get scared about sharing my feelings, I think about how you do it, and then I get the courage to share how I feel. Every time I do share my feelings, I only get love in return. Thank you for showing me how to be honest with others.

Your passion, your love, your eloquence, your vulnerability, your eye for heart and your amazing singing voice—all that and so much more makes you second to no one on this earth. You are an amazing person.

That said, I can’t stop telling others on how awesome you are and how I _get_ to know you, live life with you, help raise you, and getting to see you grow up into a wonderful passionate young man. I love getting to speak to your Mom about your life now and your life in the future. I am so thrilled that I get to see all of your life.

I am your number one fan, Gabe. I will always have your back. I will always be your friend. I will always be here for you. I will always pray over you for God to bless you, keep you, shower his grace upon you, give you peace and love you. You are always on my heart and mind.

I love you, Gabe. I love you so much. Thank you for loving me the way that only you can.

&nbsp;

From your truly honored stepfather,

Joe
