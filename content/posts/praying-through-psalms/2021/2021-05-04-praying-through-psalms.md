<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
King
</div>

```text
I sit and wait
  for your command
  you are my King.

I will pray
  for your love
  you are my Lord.

I will obey
  in your grace
  you are my Savior

I will run the race
  in your strength
  you are my Life.

I will fly
  in your freedom
  you are my Redeemer.

I will worship
  in your love
  you are God.

Amen.
```
