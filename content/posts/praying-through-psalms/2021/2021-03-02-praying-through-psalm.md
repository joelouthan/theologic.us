You Are My Help
</div>

```text
I don't pretend to understand
Or can even teach
Or comprehend
Why you would answer my prayers.

But just like those in the Bible,
I called on you
And you answered
And you rescued me.

Sometimes I will pray
And you will not answer my questions
I have taken that to mean
I will wait upon the Lord
Because you alone are my refuge and strength
My portion
My help in my very hour of need.

I have seen the faith of my grandmother
Who prayed for you to save my dad
And you did!

And I have seen my grandmother
Pray for you to save me
and you did!

I know you alone are mighty to save
Because salvation belongs to you.

Save me
Save my children
Save my household
Save their households

Lord,

Save us all
So that together
We can worship you.

Be my God.

Amen.
```
