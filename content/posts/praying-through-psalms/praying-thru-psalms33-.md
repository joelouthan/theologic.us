The Lyrics of the Sweetest Songs
</div>

```text
With my voice
  with every breath
  I will shout out
  I will cry out
  I will sing your holy name
  I will dance with joy

Because you alone are
  good
  worthy
  beautiful
  lovely
  wonderful
  peace
  joy
  exalted
  and raised far above
  all of my gods

I will worship you
  forever I will worship
  there is none like you
```
