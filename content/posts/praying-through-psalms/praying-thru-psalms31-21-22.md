```text
Who is like you, my Lord,
  clothed in majesty
  and who alone is good.

When I have realized
 the extent of my pain
 the depths of my sin
 the torment of my evil soul
 the wickedness of the Devil
 and the infection of my heart.

I called upon you
  and swiftly, you answered me.
  "Here I am!"
  and in your gentleness
  and loving kindness
  and grace abounding
  saved me to yourself.

Be exalted.

My Lord, be exalted.

Amen.

```
