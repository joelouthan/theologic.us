<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  Dear God,
</div>

```text
My enemies are on all sides 
  and their attacks are relentless, 
  you are my protector.

When lions clamp down on my guts, 
  you are the teeth-breaker and my healer.

When I am buried, 
  you call me out of the ground.

When I was dead in my sins, 
  you lived, died, and rose alive
  so that I might live.

You have never left me.

You have always been with me 
  even when I did not know nor loved you.

You have always been there.

And I will forever worship you, my God.
```
