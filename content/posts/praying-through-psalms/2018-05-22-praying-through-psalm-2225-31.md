<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My Worthy Lord,
</div>

```text
Let my words 
  and my songs be a sweetness to your ears.

For I know 
  that you sit on the throne of our praises 
  because you are the God who alone saves.

I know 
  that not only are you willing 
  and able to save,
  you 
  and you alone are the only one who is mighty to save.

So I praise you with all of my breath 
  and strength 
  and life.

And you have commissioned me 
  to go tell everyone
  everywhere of everything 
  that you have done. 
  That if they turn to you,
  you will save them,
  even in their deepest,
  darkest despair.

So I preach of you 
  and your great gospel.

Until every knee bows 
  and every tongue confess 
  that Jesus Christ is Lord,
  my Rock,
  and my Redeemer forever.
```
