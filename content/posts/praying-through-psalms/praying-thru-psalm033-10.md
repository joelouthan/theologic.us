```text
We read in your word
  where you have called a tiny nation
  unto you
  to carry out your promises
  to established your covenants.

Perhaps for a moment
  this nation would worship you
  praise you
  and love you.

But not even a generation would pass
  before they worship other gods
  distrust you
  and fall far away from you.

That is just like any of us
  that is just like me
  I have cling to other idols
  I have not given you a second thought
  I have hated you.

So Lord,
  save me
  keep me
  call upon me
  to preach to nations
  call them to repent
  and turn their hearts towards you.

For one day,
  all the nations will cease to rage
  and they will worship you
  because you are on your throne

Oh, King of kings
Oh my Lord of Lords
Blessed be your glorious name.
