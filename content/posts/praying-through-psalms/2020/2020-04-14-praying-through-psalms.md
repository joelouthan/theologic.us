```text
How many times, my God,
  must you rescue me?

How many times, O Lord,
  will you come running
  when I call your name?

But I am wicked and violent man,
  and violence has me surrounded on all sides?

But you, O my Lord, rescued me
  saved me
  because you loved me
  from the very beginning.
I need you, Lord,
  now more than ever.
I am in desperate need of your hand
  to rescue me
  from despair
  and violence.
Be my blessed Rock
  forever. Amen.

```
