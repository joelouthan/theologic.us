```text
Your Word stands true.

For you have declared that,
  your law is perfect
  and it revives my soul.

Your testimony is *sure*,
  turning my foolishness
  into wisdom.

Moreover, your precepts are always right,
  my heart rejoices.

Your commandments are pure,
  now my eyes can now see.

To fear you is my righteousness,
  I will be with you forever.

Once more, your rules are truth,
  and right-standing altogether.

I desire you, O Lord,
  more so than all the riches.

I love you, my God,
  and you are sweeter than honey,
  and the drippings of
    a honeycomb.

If you say you have spoken to me,
  then you will abide me forever.

If you say your Son died for me
  then I will live to you forever.

If you say your Spirit has sealed me,
  then I am yours forever.
Be exalted in my praise,
  my Lord and God.

```
