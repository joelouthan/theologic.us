```text
Where are you?

I am in trouble!

Sin and wickedness have surrounded me.
  Everything goes dark and cold. 
  Satan and his minions 
  look upon my flesh with lust and hunger.

Temptations are too much. 
  I cannot do battle. 
  My muscles are weak, small, and frail.

I cry and scream: HELP ME, O GOD!

But you are my powerful Champion. 
  You are the people’s Savior. 
  You are invincible. 
  You are forever strong.

I have praised you in the past 
  and my lips shall sing of your praises 
  for as long as I draw breath and beyond.

Your people before me 
  trusted you 
  and I trust you now. 
  You have never failed me. 
  Even when there have been moments 
  when I didn’t know your goodness, 
  you were always good.

You have rescued my grandmother and my dad.

Now rescue me!

Save me, O God.

My life is in your hands.
