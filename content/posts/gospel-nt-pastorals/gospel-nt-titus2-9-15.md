## The Introduction

We wrap up the second chapter of Titus with us focusing the theme of chapter 2 in our teaching of one another. Surely, we know that there are those whom God has qualified to teach and shepherd great and small portions of His flock. But to us all who believe and trust in His name, we are given careful instruction to teach and encourage one another. Why? We are in Christ and Christ taught us all. Therefore, since we are in Christ and "being conformed to the image of Christ" (Romans 8:29), we are to teach one another in some capacity or form. Peer to peer, older to younger, youth to the elder, husband to wife--we are charged to teach these commands of God. For

>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 (CSB) “Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead. Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates.

We are one with Christ. We are commanded to do like Christ.
