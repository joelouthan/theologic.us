## The Introduction

I told you that in Paul's second letter to Timothy, Paul is going to get a lot more personal--not only speaking to Timothy but calling out a few people in Timothy's church by name.

I have often preached against gossip and slander. Is this what Paul did? We are about to find out but that is not the point of the passage.

What is the point is what God has done and what is this new life we *get* to live all because of what God has done in us.

## The Text

>2 Timothy 1:13–2:2 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 

><sup> 15 </sup> You know that all those in the province of Asia have deserted me, including Phygelus (Fa-gel-us) and Hermogenes (Her-ma-jen-ease). 

><sup> 16 </sup> May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus (Anna-sif-four-us), because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. 

><sup> 17 </sup> On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me. 

><sup> 18 </sup> May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy from him on that day. You know very well how much he ministered at Ephesus. 

><sup> 1 </sup> You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

><sup> 2 </sup> What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

## The Meditation

- What Paul calls out to Timothy
- is what Christ calls to us
- we are his disciples
- Timothy is a disciple
- Paul is a disciple
- How about you?
- Let us examine

><sup> 13 </sup> Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 

### Christ's called disciples: Learn from God

- living in the age of information
- we have sound teaching
- most of us wouldn't know
- because we don't care
- or we are too busy chasing down what we want to hear
- reminded of sermons about you--about what you can do and what you need to do better
- vs. sermons that are about God, what he has done and what he is commanded us to do

><sup> 14 </sup> Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 

### Christ's called disciples: Stand with God

- don't ignore what God has given you
- he is not going to take anything back
- and yes we should try to grow in these gifts
- but you also shouldn't waste a moment being obedient to God
- don't ignore but also Holy Spirit is the final guard
- falling away from the faith yet still can teach, preach, and minister
- you are to obey God and minister to others in that love
- don't dare bastardize his good gifts--starting with his gift of salvation
- Spirit of power, love, and self-control

><sup> 15 </sup> You know that all those in the province of Asia have deserted me, including Phygelus (Fa-gel-us) and Hermogenes (Her-ma-jen-ease). 

### Christ's called disciples: Minister to God's people

- Two or three gathered, I am there among them
- if we pray together or alone, yes he is there with us
- but also
- when church goers continue to not repent of sin
- Christ's instruction

>Matthew 18:15-20 (CSB) “If your brother sins against you, go tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.<sup> 16 </sup>But if he won’t listen, take one or two others with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established.<sup> 17 </sup>If he doesn’t pay attention to them, tell the church. If he doesn’t pay attention even to the church, let him be like a Gentile and a tax collector to you.<sup> 18 </sup>Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.<sup> 19 </sup>Again, truly I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about any matter that you pray for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.<sup> 20 </sup>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them.”

In other words:

>Matthew 7:6 (CSB) Don’t give what is holy to dogs or toss your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, turn, and tear you to pieces.

- when you minister to others, Christ is with you
- when you pray, Christ is with you
- but when you have to let go of someone and treat them as they are unsaved and do not believe because they do not believe, God is with you and with them
- be patient
- preach the gospel
- pray for them

><sup> 16 </sup> May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus (Ana-sif-four-us), because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. <sup> 17 </sup> On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me. <sup> 18 </sup> May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy from him on that day. You know very well how much he ministered at Ephesus. 

### Christ's called disciples: Rejoice with God's people

- but to those who do trust in him and believe in his name, give over holiness and give pearls to them
- all the good spiritual things from God--toss them their way
- That is ministry

>Philippians 4:8-9 (CSB) Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any moral excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—dwell on these things. 9 Do what you have learned and received and heard from me, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.

- Those with the spirit of adoption, it is not wasted on them
- which blows me away when non-believers keep wanting to go to church and yet their hearts never turn
- that's why Romans 1:16-17 says that the gospel is the power of God in salvation for those who believe--not those who do and don't believe
- likewise, John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believes--not whosoever believes and does not believe--will have everlasting life

## The Gospel

Let me send you out with some good news.

><sup> 1 </sup> You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

### Christ's called disciples: God's strength is for you

>Ephesians 6:10 (CSB) Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.

>Romans 8:31-32 (CSB) What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 32 He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything?

- God has given you his Son
- God has given you his Spirit
- God has given you his grace
- God has given you his strength
- God has given himself
- Now go and do his will

><sup> 2 </sup> What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

### Christ's called disciples: God has called you together

- You are the church
- Do not forsake gathered assembly
- because God has saved you to himself
- God has saved you to one another
- we are his children
- we are family
- easier said than done
- because people who seek to devour us little lambs
- we are all the more dependent on Christ as our Good Shepherd
- We bank on his promises--Psalm 23, Jeremiah 23, John 10--
