## The Text

>Titus 3:1–7 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, 

><sup> 2 </sup> to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people. 

><sup> 3 </sup> For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. 

><sup> 4 </sup> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 

><sup> 5 </sup> he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. 

><sup> 6 </sup> He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior 

><sup> 7 </sup> so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.
