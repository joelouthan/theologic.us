&#8220;In addition to the exhaustive depth of his knowledge is the exhaustive breadth of his knowledge. God is aware of every event that has ever occurred and will ever occur, and he knows completely how each event affects other events that create still more events that roll into other events and so on and so forth _ad infinitum_. From the velocity of every butterfly’s flapping wings at every second to the exact amount of magma to the microgram flowing out of every volcano above and under sea level, he spans it all simultaneously and precisely. If a tree falls in the woods when nobody&#8217;s there to hear it, does it make a sound? I don&#8217;t know. But God does.

He knows it all without any sticky noties or strings on his finger. He is holding all things together, seeing all things and knowing all things, all purely from the reality of his wanting it be so. This is, at the very least, what it means to be God. [<sup>1</sup>][1]{#return-note-2113-1.simple-footnote}

If all of this is true, then why in the world do we, with our nanosecond&#8217;s worth of existence on the earth, still presume to judge how God operates? Paul&#8217;s cry, &#8220;Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!&#8221; [<sup>2</sup>][2]{#return-note-2113-2.simple-footnote} holds up (as praiseworthy) the enduring reality of divine mystery. Trying to figure out God is like trying to catch fish in the Pacific Ocean with an inch of dental floss. It is a foolish act predicated on a foolish overestimation of human intellect and ability.&#8221;
