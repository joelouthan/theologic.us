1. _When we hardened our hearts against God's love (we refuse to hear what God has to say, we refuse to believe what God has done), does God still love us?_

2. _When we hardened our hearts against God (mad at him, accuse him of being bad), does God still shows us his love?_

Mark 6:53-56 **When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.**

3. _Where was the power coming from? Was it because Jesus had a magic cloak?_

4. _Did Jesus preach in this town?_

5. _What has more power? The healing of Jesus, the walking on water by Jesus, or the words of Jesus?_

Genesis 1:3 **And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.**

Isaiah 55:11 **so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.**

Romans 1:16 **For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.**

Romans 10:17 **So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.**
