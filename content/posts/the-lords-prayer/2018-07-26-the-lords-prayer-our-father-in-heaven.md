  Romans 8:14-17 <b>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>Our Father in heaven </b>— My Jesus, You have told me this so that I may know this: I can now come to the Father. My Father is mindful of me, and His will has already dictated our relationship to be so. You have done all the work. The Spirit bears witness with my Spirit that I am a child of God.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This same Spirit that raised You from the grave dwells in me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the Holy Spirit lives in me, He gives me the power, the right and privilege to go and be with the Father.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Father, I cannot think of You like some cruel, ruthless, thoughtless, mindless man voided of compassion and love. I dare not compare You in light of an earthly father. You are exalted and high and lifted up, all earthly fathers held in the view of You. You, O God, are good and do nothing but good.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Your faith is given to me and with this new heart You have given me, I now get to trust in You when Christ says, “Our Father is our perfect Father in heaven.” That means You are perfect in love, perfect in compassion, perfect in mercy, perfect in grace, perfect in judgment, holiness, righteousness, and faithfulness.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You, my Father in heaven, are high and lifted up above all other gods and all over the earth. You are the Triune God who is in the perfect community and perfect love, sufficient and satisfying in Yourself and needed no one else and nothing else. You are the Creator God who sees all and knows all.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are all around the earth, and Your glory fills the earth. You are all-powerful, never to be limited to what You can and cannot do.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  For I am certain: You are holy, far above our tragic depravity and our laughable idols; You are so far and distant as You cannot dare not to look upon our sins.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This is so very true: I am a stranger before you and lost as our Fathers were.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, my days on the earth are like a shadow, and there was no hope (1 Chronicles 29:15). But, despite my horrific sin, my wicked thoughts, my desperately sick heart, my numerous transgressions; my gruesome pride; and in spite of me being so far away from You, You loved me so much that You thought of me from eternity past. Because You wanted me to be with You, You sent Your Son to do whatever it takes to bring me to You.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And You Son did it, perfectly, by your Spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jesus Christ did so by giving over His perfect, spotless life for my cancerous, sin-infested, death-filled “life.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did so by taking on Your just punishment that was meant for me and then poured out his blood to clean away all of my sins, wickedness, iniquities, transgressions, and evil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it is by Your Spirit and by Your will, Your Son rose from death.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Why did You save me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have not a clue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did nothing to deserve Your gracious and everlasting love, even less so, Your undivided attention.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  All I know is that I was once lost, now found; once blind, now I can see; once dead; now fully alive in You.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All because of what You have done.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I love You, my God.
