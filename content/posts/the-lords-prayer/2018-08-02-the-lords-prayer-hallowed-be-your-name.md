<p class="p1">
  Revelation 4:8 <b>And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,<br /> </b><b>who was and is and is to come!”</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>Hallowed be Your name </b>— Because You are my good Father in heaven, I now get to say this:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are holy.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are far above, far from all of my sin, and the sins of the world.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You shine the brightest. You are the most glorious. Your holiness is a fire unquenched. Your holiness rejects and vomits out all of my trespasses.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Our sins, our trespasses, our wickedness, our transgressions and our iniquities keep us infinitely far for You.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Before You, we are complete strangers. <a class="simple-footnote" title="1 Chronicles 29:15" id="return-note-3740-1" href="#note-3740-1"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Before You, we are children who sit under Your just and necessary wrath. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Ephesians 2:3" id="return-note-3740-2" href="#note-3740-2"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Before You, we are dead. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Ephesians 2:5" id="return-note-3740-3" href="#note-3740-3"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Yet, oh how good and wonderful that You sent Your Son across that infinite separation through the shattered cosmos and into our broken lives as Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God to be not only fully God but also fully man.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  For it is Him who made the way back to You!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Now that we get to be with You, Your Son shows us how to pray and Your Spirit prays with us. Apart from Your sovereign grace, the bloodshed and broken body of Your Son on that cross and the power of Your Spirit, not only did I not know You but I actively waged war against Your holy name.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But because Jesus Christ, Your Son, and my Savior, laid out the path to You, I get to enjoy Your company. Because of Your Son’s life, death and resurrection are the absolute truth that we might get to fully enjoy You forever and ever.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And because of Your Spirit’s awesome power, You claim us to be Yours forever.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You have always known me and You will always know me. You will not forget me nor forsake me. You have always loved me and you will always love me. You are so good to me and you will not stop being good to me.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  How glorious is Your Name!
