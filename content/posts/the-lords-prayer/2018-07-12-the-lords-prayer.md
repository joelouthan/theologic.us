**Pray then like this:**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>“Our Father in heaven,</strong><br /> <strong>hallowed be Your name.</strong><br /> <strong>Your kingdom come,</strong><br /> Your<strong> will be done,</strong><br /> <strong>on earth as it is in heaven.</strong><br /> <strong>Give us this day our daily bread,</strong><br /> <strong>and forgive us our debts,</strong><br /> <strong>as we also have forgiven our debtors.</strong><br /> <strong>And lead us not into temptation,</strong><br /> <strong>but deliver us from evil.</strong>
</p>

**For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.** [<sup>1</sup>][1]{#return-note-3693-1.simple-footnote}
