  Matthew 16:15-19 <b>He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <strong>Your kingdom come</strong>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are God. You are so exalted and so glorious that You have declared Your only begotten Son the King of kings and the Lord of lords <a class="simple-footnote" title="1 Timothy 6:15, Revelation 17:14, Revelation 19:16 cf. Daniel 7:9-14" id="return-note-3800-1" href="#note-3800-1"></a>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You are God above all of our made-up gods created by our wicked hearts and hands.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You rule and You reign over all creation. There is not one square inch, not one tiny little atom of this universe that You, who is sovereign over all, have not proclaimed and vehemently declared, “Mine!”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You rule over all the heavens and the earth, all nations and all seas, all governments and all leaders, over every city and neighborhood. You rule over all languages, tribes and people groups.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You rule over our wills, our minds, our hearts, our spirits, our feelings and our beliefs.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Therefore, You are exalted above all.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Your kingdom come and it will advance no matter what. The Church is built upon Christ as our Solid Rock and not even the gates of hell can contain your Bride. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Matthew 16:18" id="return-note-3800-2" href="#note-3800-2"></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Your kingdom expands and advances, all because of Your sovereign will through Your Son’s violent death upon that cross by the power of Your Spirit, the call goes forth: that there is the only One True God who passionately, continuously, relentlessly, lovingly pursues every single person who continues to this day to breath Your air. And we, indwelled with Your Holy Spirit, have been commissioned as heralds—princes and princesses of the great King—to the world proclaiming these things:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the wicked, You will give Your righteousness.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the fallen, You lift to restoration.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the captives, You hold the keys to death and Hell, proclaim freedom and set the captives free. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Isaiah 61:1" id="return-note-3800-3" href="#note-3800-3"></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the blind, Your truth shines brighter than the sun and makes all things as they are—all the more radiant and more beautiful—and you will let them see Your glory.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the deaf, never have our ears heard sweeter melodies and lovelier whispers.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  To the dead, You bring the true life, the fullness of joy and pleasures evermore.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  All that You have asked of is that we trust in You.
</p>
