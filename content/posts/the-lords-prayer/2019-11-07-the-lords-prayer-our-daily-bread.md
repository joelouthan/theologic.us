**Matthew 6:11 Give us this day our daily bread,** 

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My God,
</div>

What is your provision for me? Do I need food, shelter, and water just to stay alive?

But what is life? Is it that my heart pumps blood or my lungs breath in and out air? Is it because my skin is warm to the touch?

No. It is not merely those things.

For once upon a time, I was dead in my trespasses and my sins, following the paths of the world, following Satan and his demons, with the spirit that is in the sons of disobedience. For my desperate and sick heart was once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing my days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.

But what did you do? How did you respond to my madness and wickedness?

You word says that You, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which you have loved me, even when I was dead in my trespasses, made me alive together with Christ—by grace I have been saved—and raised me up with him and seated me with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.


Your word also says, when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, you saved me, not because of works done by me in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on me richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace I might become an heir according to the hope of eternal life.

Also, this is true: because I believe in that Jesus is the Christ, I am born again of God. And because I love you, you love me because I have been born of You.

This I am fully convince: my daily portion is you. You are my lot and my inheritance. You are my everything. You are my All-in-all.

My Savior said this to me: "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."

And I know if I go to You, ask You for You, You will give me You for you cannot deny Yourself to those who seek and desire you.

I ask for you. Today. Give me Yourself. So I will never hunger again and I will never thirst again.

Amen.
