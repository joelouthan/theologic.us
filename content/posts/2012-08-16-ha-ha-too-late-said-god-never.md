As the poor souls fall through space, they cry out for mercy, but God says &#8220;Too late!&#8221; You had your chance! Now you will suffer!&#8221; This caricature misunderstands the very nature of evil. The Biblical picture is that sin separates us from the presence of God, which is the source of all joy and indeed all love, wisdom, or good things of any sort. Since we were originally created for God&#8217;s immediate presence, only before his face will we thrive, flourish, and achieve our highest potential. If we were to lose his presence totally, that would be hell—the loss of our capability for giving or receiving love or joy.
