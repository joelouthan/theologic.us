  Careful handling of the Bible will enable us to &#8220;hear&#8221; it a little better. It is all too easy to read the traditional interpretations and invest them with a false, even idolatrous, degree of certainty. Because traditions are reshaped as they are passed on, after a while we may drift far from God&#8217;s Word while still insisting all our theological opinions are &#8220;biblical&#8221; and therefore true. If when we are in such a state we study the Bible uncritically, more than likely it will simply reinforce our errors. If the Bible is to accomplish its work of continual reformation &#8211; reformation in our lives and our doctrine &#8211; we must do all we can to listen to it afresh, and utilize the best resources at our disposal.
