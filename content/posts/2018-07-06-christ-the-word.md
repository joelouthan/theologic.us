<pre><blockquote>
  When I sin against thee I cross thy will, love, life,
    and have no comforter, no creature, to go to.
  My sin is not so much this or that particular evil,
    but my continual separation, disunion,
      distance from thee,
    and having a loose spirit towards thee.
  But thou hast given me a present, Jesus thy Son,
    as Mediator between thyself and my soul,
    as middle-man who in a pit
      holds both him below and him above,
    for only he can span the chasm breached by sin,
    and satisfy divine justice.
</blockquote></pre>
