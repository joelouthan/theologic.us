<p class="p1">
  Psalm 97:9 <b>For you, O LORD,<br /> </b><b>are most high over all the earth;<br /> </b><b>you are exalted far above all gods. </b>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And how can we even fathom this glory of God? How can we fully look upon God in his sheer radiance, beauty, and majesty without our minds and eyes and hearts shutting down?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is sheer madness.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And that is exactly what God wants! He wants to be with him forever and ever. With him. Not “the whole earth is filled with his glory” or even “he dwells within us” type of presence that we are so use to and dare I say, at ease with.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But understand what Christ has done in us for us:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Hebrews 9:25–28" id="return-note-3610-1" href="#note-3610-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  He takes away sin. All sin. For the whole world. For all of his people. And when we are with him, finally with him, we will be with him in a place where “<b>nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life</b>” and “<b>no longer will there be anything accursed</b>.” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Revelation 21:22–22:5" id="return-note-3610-2" href="#note-3610-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Because of Christ took away sin, “<b>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</b>” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Revelation 21:4" id="return-note-3610-3" href="#note-3610-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But then, it is more than removing sin, evil, Satan, demons and death.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  He puts in the fullness of holiness, righteousness, love, joy, peace, grace, mercy, and justice. Namely, He puts himself in with us.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Revelation 22:5" id="return-note-3610-4" href="#note-3610-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Can we truly comprehend worshiping our sweet king forever? No! Can we ponder what it is like to worship with the God who saved us? Brother and sister, there have plenty of times I could not manage my own debt nor waistline. So you know I am not even thinking about reigning with him.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But that is what He said we will be.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The same God who <b>made known for me the path of life</b> and therefore, because of all that Christ has done, when I do get to him, I will experience the <b>fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore</b>. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Psalm 16:11" id="return-note-3610-5" href="#note-3610-5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is only there when we will finally experience “<b>the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.</b>” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Philippians 4:7" id="return-note-3610-6" href="#note-3610-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is only there when we will finally <b>“behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.”</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Psalm 17:15" id="return-note-3610-7" href="#note-3610-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The God who is glorious is the same one who is glorifies his children.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, </b><i> </i><b>and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. </b><i> </i><b>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Romans 8:16–18" id="return-note-3610-8" href="#note-3610-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I am not even doing a great job of extrapolating the glory of God. If I had the fullness of the Spirit and the highest IQ and all the gifts of wordsmithing and writing and had infinite time and resources, perhaps, I could tell you a sliver of his glory.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <b>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true. </b><i> </i><b>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</b> <a class="simple-footnote" title="John 21:24–25" id="return-note-3610-9" href="#note-3610-9"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Well, one day, with infinite light, infinite energy, and infinite worshiping my sweet King, I will attempt to write about his glory.
</p>

Until then, I pray:

If Your promises hold true—if You say You will make all things right despite our folly and sin [<sup>10</sup>][1]{#return-note-3610-10.simple-footnote}; if You say You will bear our iniquities and our trespasses [<sup>11</sup>][2]{#return-note-3610-11.simple-footnote} and You will draw near to us just when we think You are so far away [<sup>12</sup>][3]{#return-note-3610-12.simple-footnote}, then my life and my love is all in Your Word. I have nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to.

Who can I trust? Where I can seek refuge in? Where shall I go? For you alone have the words to eternal life. [<sup>13</sup>][4]{#return-note-3610-13.simple-footnote}

Whom have I in heaven but You? Is there anyone on earth I desire besides You? My heart and flesh will fail but you are my strength and my portion forever. [<sup>14</sup>][5]{#return-note-3610-14.simple-footnote}

This much is true: for you are my God. You loved me and you are always mindful of me even before you created time and space.

You have shown the awesome worth of your love by sending and giving Your precious Son to me.

You have shown the infinite might of your power by giving your Spirit to me.

So what then can I say?

So what then can I do?

All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,
  
I thank you for giving me strength.
  
Thank you my Father God.
  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.
  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.

You judged me faithful.
  
You appointed to Your service.
  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,
  
Your holy name,
  
despite my persecution and hatred
  
those who love you,
  
despite my perverted and violent opposition
  
towards you,

Still
  
I only received mercy
  
because I was lost
  
I was lame
  
I was deaf
  
I was blind
  
I was stupid
  
I was ignorant
  
I was evil
  
I was dead
  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender
  
love, mercy and grace
  
overflowed for me
  
overwhelmingly
  
undeservingly
  
ill-deservingly
  
with your unbroken faithfulness
  
and your relentless love
  
that can only be by You,
  
for You,
  
through You,
  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.

These words
  
out of my heart
  
are true
  
and with all of my hope and dreams
  
and desires and wishes
  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.

I know
  
that you came in this world
  
to rescue your people
  
to pull them out of despair
  
to give your people life
  
to save them from their sins
  
to bring them to you
  
evil sinners
  
at war with you
  
All of us
  
And I lead this group.
  
I am the foremost
  
I am their chief
  
I am their victor
  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!

Yet,
  
in this reason
  
that Your grace abounds all the more
  
that Your mercy renews every morning
  
that Your love never ceases
  
that You
  
my Lord and Savior
  
Jesus Christ
  
might display

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,
  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience
  
for all of those who You call Yours
  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.

This is why I will sing
  
to the God of the everlasting to the everlasting
  
the Triune
  
the Father
  
the Son
  
the Holy Spirit
  
the immortal
  
the invisible
  
the Only One
  
the Creator
  
the Sustainer
  
the Merciful
  
the Peace
  
the Grace
  
the Faith
  
the Messiah
  
the Immanuel, God with Us
  
the Blessed
  
the Living Word
  
the Christ
  
the Son of God
  
the Fellow Heir
  
the Second Adam
  
the Kinsman Redeemer
  
the Beginning
  
the Means
  
the End
  
the Majesty
  
the Truth
  
the Way
  
the Life
  
the Wisdom
  
the Teacher
  
the Rescuer
  
the Promise
  
the Calling
  
the Fulfillment
  
the Abundance
  
the Host
  
the Governor
  
the High Priest
  
the Prophet
  
the Apostle
  
the Sufferer
  
the Messiah
  
the Servant
  
the Son of Man
  
the Glorified
  
the Power
  
the Gospel
  
the Guide
  
the Elector
  
the All-Sufficient
  
the Lion of Judah
  
the Worthy Lamb who was slain
  
the King of all kings
  
the Lord of all lords
  
the Commander
  
the Ruler above all
  
the Name above all Names
  
the Wonderful Counselor
  
the Mighty God
  
the Everlasting Father
  
the Prince of Peace

my Holiness
  
my Righteousness
  
my Justice
  
my Faithfulness
  
my Mercy
  
my Grace
  
my Friend
  
my Confidence
  
my Pastor
  
my Elder
  
my Brother
  
my Assurance
  
my Redeemer
  
my Rock
  
my Salvation
  
my All in all
  
my Exalted
  
my Glorious
  
my Beloved
  
my Joy
  
my Song
  
my Love

my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah
  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart
  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.

So I will be so very careful to
  
worship,
  
sing,
  
praise,
  
glorify,
  
exalt,
  
proclaim,
  
honor,
  
dedicate,
  
and love
  
You alone.

I pray this desperately and joyfully,
  
in the beautiful,
  
sweet,
  
precious,
  
most tender,
  
loveliest,
  
most worthy,
  
dearest name of
  
Your Son.

His name is
  
the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.
