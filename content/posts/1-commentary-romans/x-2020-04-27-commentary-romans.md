**Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.**

### For salvation

In salvation, people often think that one might be saved from sin, Satan, demons, hell and even death. That is quite true but salvation does not begin nor end there. All of those things fall some way of the wrath of God.

â€‹		Matthew 10:28 **And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.** 

Salvation is a saving from the wrath of God *and* saving to the presence, sanctuary, and love of God forever.

With salvation, comes many things. Consider all that God does for His people:

- elects His people
- calls to His people
- justifies His people
- saves them from their sin
- saves them from His wrath
- saves Him to himself
- redeems His people
- adopts His people as His children
- makes them co heirs with Christ 
- cleanses them from all unrighteousness
- conforms them into the likeness of His Son
- disciplines his kids
- keeps his kids
- raises his people to glory

And on and on it goes.
