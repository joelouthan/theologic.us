**Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.**

*We now know what is the gospel of God. Why should we not be ashamed of it?*

Not ashamed preaching of the word

Not ashamed great commission

Not ashamed defense of the faith

Not ashamed worship of God

Not ashamed leading our families

Not ashamed private quiet devotion

Not ashamed of the gospel of God
