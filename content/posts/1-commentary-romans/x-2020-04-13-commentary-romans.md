**Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.**

*What is the gospel?* Simply put, the gospel *is* the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 

A simple yet packed statement. What does it all really mean?

### The power of God

Consider this about the power of God: He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present. But we might see the word 'all' and still not fathom that strength. We can describe it as *infinite* and *perfect*, and still not fully get it. 

Let us say it another way: there are many people who be willing to save people but lack the *ability* to save. All of mankind has been both born into sin and does sin continually. Even in our good acts are all done with wicked and selfish motives. We have committed the sin and we alone have to atone for our sins. The problem is that because of our sin, we cannot atone for it. We need to be perfect in order to atone for our sins. Because we were born into sin and with sin-filled hearts, we cannot possibly be perfect. This isn't a huge problem except we are created by a holy, righteous, and perfect Creator God who does not allows sin to abide within in presence. Why would a good and just God allow sin--wickedness, trespasses, evil, tyranny, despair--into his presence? And the truly unfortunate thing for us and sin is that our paths will cross before this Almighty God. As the angels cried out in Isaiah 6:3 **And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!”** God is all over the earth. And every one of us will stand before this righteous and just God who does not allow sin into his dwelling. He is holy. He is high above sin, far from sin, too bright for sin, too hot and burns sin, and he expels and vomits out sin.[^end]

### For salvation

### To everyone who believes

But is that oversimplification? 

The power of God for salvation:

- who God is
- power of God
- what did God do
- mere gospel 

Everyone who believes

- Distinction: Not to everyone
- Does not say "believes and does not believe"
- John 3:16 "whosoever believes and does not believe"
- Gospel *only* saves those who believe and trust Jesus Christ. Gospel does not save anybody who does not believe.

What does God do with his people

- elects His people
- calls to His people
- justifies His people
- saves them from their sin
- saves them from His wrath
- saves Him to himself
- redeems His people
- adopts His people as His children
- makes them co heirs with Christ 
- cleanses them from all unrighteousness
- conforms them into the likeness of His Son
- disciplines his kids
- keeps his kids
- glorifies his children

What does God do with unbelievers?
