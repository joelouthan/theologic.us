**Romans 1:18â€“20 (ESV) For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.** 

## The Wrath of God

Righteousness of God versus unrighteousness of God

When mankind (secularism or religion) tries to figure out the righteousness of God (His way versus all other ways), we will sometimes come up with a third way. The more religion and legalism, the greater the need for a third way.

Wrath of God on those who do not obey the Son of God

Wrath of God on those who do not obey the Spirit of God

Wrath of God upon the Son on the cross for the sins of His people
