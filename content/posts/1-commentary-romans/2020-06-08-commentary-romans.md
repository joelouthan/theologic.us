**Romans 1:18–20 (ESV) For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.** For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 

## The Wrath of God

For many of us, we might be invigorated 

Two ways to suppress the truth of God’s righteousness and his just wrath on deserving sinners. 

First, create another way to escape the wrath of God other than under the alien and imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ. Usually, the more religious and the more legalist, the more for a need for good, morally people who may not believe in Jesus nor necessarily obey the Son but in our own judgement, think that certain people do deserve hell and certain people do deserve heaven. And of course, the individual will make sure that the line between heaven and hell falls in such a way to where they get to go to heaven because “I’m might not be perfect but I am certainly not as bad as this guy over here.”

Second, deny absolute truth which in our day is to deny truth of the Bible. 

But what does the Bible say. 

Christ is the line. He is the standard. The ESV as to use a contractor’s term in calling God the plumb line. To his left, the goats, the unbelievers, the workers of lawlessness. To his right, sinners saved by His grace, obedient only because the Father gave them his heart and His Spirit and trusted and believed his word, sanctified by the power of the Spirit and glorified in the end.
