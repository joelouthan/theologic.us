### as it written, "The righteous shall live by faith."

Along with Romans 1:17, Paul mentions this Habakukan passage in Galatians and along with the author to Hebrews as well.

> Galatians 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “**The righteous shall live by faith.**”
>
> Hebrews 10:38 but **my righteous one shall live by faith**, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”
>
> Habakkuk 2:4 “Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the **righteous shall live by his faith**.

A good rule of thumb in determining Biblical doctrine is this: if it is mentioned once, it is usually not consider primary, Biblical, orthodox right theology and doctrine. Consider the doctrine of sects and cults such as Mormons (among other things, baptism for the dead, according to 1 Corinthians 15:29), Jehovah's Witnesses (Christ is not God according to John 3:16 *God's only begotten son*), and sects born out of Restoration Movement such as Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ (Baptism regeneration according to John 3:5). Sects and cults out of Christianity all have this one thing in common: take a standalone verse, not repeated nor confirmed anywhere else in Scripture (antithesis of *Sola scriptura*), and proceed to make primary doctrine out of that one verse.

The difference between those sects and cults versus orthodox Christianity is the orthodox Christianity primary doctrine is based through explicit, clear, often repeated teachings throughout the  Bible. Some of these you might recognize is that the Lord God is One, God is Triune, Father is God, Christ is God, and Spirit is God. You might recognize these primary teachings because they are often repeated in Creeds repeated in liturgical worship services throughout the world.

*What is faith?*

*What is truth?*

*What the implications of believing and trusting in God?*
