Having been made an overseer by the Lord Jesus Christ,
  
affirmed as such by His Church,
  
and enabled solely by His grace,

I commit to live in a manner worthy of His calling,
  
loving Him with all my heart, soul and mind,
  
always on guard for myself that I maintain a testimony that is above reproach;

I commit to preach His Word,
  
standing ready in season and out of season,
  
never shrinking to declare to you the whole counsel of God,
  
reproving, rebuking, and exhorting with great patience and instruction;

I commit to shepherd His flock,
  
whom Christ purchased with His own blood,
  
exercising oversight with humility, leading by example,
  
and equipping His saints for the work of the ministry;

I commit to be found faithful as His steward,
  
looking to Christ alone for both judgment and praise,
  
that in all things He might have the preeminence;

And by His grace,
  
I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls
  
because He, the Chief Shepherd, spent Himself for me.
  
To Christ alone be the glory.

AMEN
