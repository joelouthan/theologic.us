_What is love?_

Isn&#8217;t that a question for the ages and especially, in our day and time? Some think it is abstract and for some, more substantial. Some flee from love and desire it all the more. Others attempt to change love in order to fit their lives and their hearts.

Often, we see these questions in our culture even when culture are not using those three little words, &#8220;what is love?&#8221;. Look at the political realm: what are the hot-button topics of our day?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Who should have the right to marry?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Should women have absolute, sovereign rights over their bodies and everything within their bodies?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  What should the government do, if anything, to combat poverty?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Should illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in this country or should they be treated like common crooks?
</p>

Even these questions get easily broken down into those three little words if we know the heart and love of God and examine them from the Christian viewpoint:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  How should we love the widow (divorced, single moms)?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  How should we love the orphan (the unborn baby, kids with no dads)?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  How should we love the poor (homeless, underemployed)?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  How should we love the lost (the immigrant, the stranger in our land)?
</p>

The world might ask, &#8220;What is love?&#8221; Yet, once we know and love God and trust in Word, the rightful question ends up:

_Who is love?_

In 1 John 4:7-8, John ends the thought with the ultimate declaration that &#8220;**God is love**&#8220;. If that is really the case, how do we evaluate love? How do we really know love? If what we call love does not stand in the light of an Almighty gracious, wonderful, beautiful and righteous God, then what do we really have?

Are we so brave to examine our thoughts about love? Maybe what we know about love is wrong. Maybe what we call love is not fulfilling, not satisfyingâ€”not loving.

In midst of all our perspectives, upbringing, hurts, desires, pains, torments, frustrations, abuses, and sin, God mercifully, majestically, humbly, and graciously responds to all of the world&#8217;s guesses and theories to the eternal question of love and altered the course of the world forever.

God, through his Word, powerfully proclaims, &#8220;**In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**&#8221; 1 John 4:9-10

Here is love: love of God made manifest, tangible, and real.

Here is love: love of God was sent into the world.

Here is love: that we might live through him and be with him forever.

Join me as we throughly and joyfully walk through the God&#8217;s declaration of &#8220;Here is love&#8221;.
