<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Lord and God,</div>
Your Son has shed his blood for me,  
	so that I now believe.

Your Son has given up his life,  
	so that I might live forever.

You have taken my sin-filled heart,  
	and my wonton desires,  
	and replaced them with your own heart,  
	and my desire is only for you.

Because you have done it all,  
	to save me to yourself,  
	I am yours.

Come make your home in me,  
	Lord Jesus, come into my heart.  
	Spirit of God, fill my life.

Make your home within me,  
	so that I might not sin against thee.
</pre>
