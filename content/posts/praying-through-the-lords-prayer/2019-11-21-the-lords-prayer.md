**Matthew 6:13 And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil.**

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Rescuer,  
</div>

Once, I was far from you. Assured of my own salvation based on what I did and nothing you have done. Yet, I sinned against you and others all the more.

I was dead. I had no life in my limbs. I had no strength to reach out to any passerby. I had no voice to call out for help because I had no breath. I was unknown. I was lost.

But you found me in the darkest hole and and the deepest ocean--beneath all of my anger, lust, wickedness, perversion, and treason. You found me cold and lifeless. You found me as a son of disobedience. You found me as a vessel of your wrath.

But you called me and you rescued me. And now I have life in you, Christ Jesus my Lord. Now, I move and dwell and have being in you alone. You have brought movement to my bones, light to my soul, and fire to my spirit. You brought me life, fullness of joy, and pleasures forevermore.

Keep me to yourself. Continue to rescue me from evil. Bring me home.

I love you. Amen.
