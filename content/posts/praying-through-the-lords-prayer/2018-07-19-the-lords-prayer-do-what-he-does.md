> Ezekiel 11:19-20 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

## Do What He Does

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Father
</div>

I hear Your words. You have given me a new heart, and now I gladly receive Your words. It is because You gave me a new heart, it is now that I can do what You have commanded me to do.

My Lord and my God, You have taught me and shown me what it is like to speak to our Father. Your instruction, Your communion, Your relationship, Your bond with the Father is on display here for me to see and learn as the example. It is so evident in the Gospels that you missed your Father so very much and took every opportunity to go and talk with him.

Sometimes when I am so happy and joyful, I will forget to spend time with you. Sometimes when I am in sin, I am too scared to go to my God. Sometimes I am too apathetic and I do not care to go to God. Sometimes I worry, I am anxious, and I tend to trust in what I can do or what I can see before my eyes instead of believing in Him who has already done the work. Lord, please help me do what You do because at that time with my Father is so precious and so good. Lord, help me do what You do because no other god can help me. You alone are the One True God. Lord, help me do what You do because Father, Son, and Spirit are One and because all that You have done, You are now in me and with me. Because of You, You are mine, and I am Yours always.

Help me not to deprive of my time with you. Help me do what You do.
