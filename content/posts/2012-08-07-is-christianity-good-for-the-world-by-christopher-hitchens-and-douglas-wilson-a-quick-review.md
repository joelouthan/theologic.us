Wilson is top-notch and has the upper hand to give the response.

Hitchens is spot-on typical atheist:

  1. Remove God from the equation
  2. Plug-in Evolution as the new source
  3. Profit$

In this, the main hard-hitting topic was Morals and Ethics or the source of Morals and Ethics.

Wilson&#8217;s explanation needs none here. Hitchens&#8217; explanation is that there is no source but rather, our morals have evolved.

Classic Romans 1:18-32.

The book is super-short and an awesome introduction to the end-of-an-era Modern Enlightened Atheist and what the Bible has said otherwise. (I must emphasized Modern Enlightened because I don&#8217;t know what a post-modern atheist looks like or is that label even possible under post-modernism. But I digress.)

Can&#8217;t recommend this highly enough. Bravo, Wilson. Bravo, Hitchens. (I wish you were still here with us.)
