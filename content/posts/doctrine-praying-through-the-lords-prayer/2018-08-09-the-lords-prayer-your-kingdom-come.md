## Pray Then Like This

>Matthew 6:10 (CSB) Your kingdom come.  
>Your will be done  
>on earth as it is in heaven.

## Your Kingdom Come

>Matthew 16:13-16 (CSB) When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”
>
>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
>
>“But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am?”
>
>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

### Christ Lived the Perfect Life that Everyone Should Have

>Philippians 2:5-11 (CSB)  
>Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus,  
>who, existing in the form of God,  
>did not consider equality with God  
>as something to be exploited.  
>Instead he emptied himself  
>by assuming the form of a servant,  
>taking on the likeness of humanity.  
>**And when he had come as a man,  
>he humbled himself by becoming obedient  
>to the point of death—  
>even to death on a cross.**  
>For this reason God highly exalted him  
>and gave him the name  
>that is above every name,  
>so that at the name of Jesus  
>every knee will bow—  
>in heaven and on earth  
>and under the earth—  
>and every tongue will confess  
>that Jesus Christ is Lord,  
>to the glory of God the Father.

### Christ Has Died--Therefore He Has Conquered All of Our Enemies

>Ephesians 6:10-13 (CSB) Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength. **Put on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens.** For this reason take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand.

#### Fear

>Romans 8:14-15 (CSB) For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”

#### Sin

>Romans 6:6-11 (CSB) For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

#### Satan and demons

>Colossians 2:9-15 (CSB) For the entire fullness of God’s nature dwells bodily in Christ, and you have been filled by him, who is the head over every ruler and authority. You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, when you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. **He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.**

#### Hell

>Matthew 16:17-20 (CSB) Jesus responded, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven. **And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.** I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.” Then he gave the disciples orders to tell no one that he was the Messiah.

#### Death

>Romans 8:7-11 (CSB) The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God’s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him. Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. **And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.**

## In His Perfect, Redeeming, Conquered Kingdom, we are now more than conquerors through him who loved us

>Romans 8:35-39 (CSB) Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written:
>
>Because of you  
>we are being put to death all day long;  
>we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
>
>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
## The Prayer

My Lord
</div>

```text
You have perfectly obeyed our Father in heaven. I believe and trust in you. You are my Savior.

You have remove my fear--place my affections and awe in you alone.

You have freed me from sin--keep me from sin.

Satan and demons have been conquered--keep me from their fiery arrows.

You have not abandoned me in Hell, you will not let me see corruption--keep me in your presence where there is only life, fullness of joy, and pleasures forevermore.

Death is a conquered foe--I am forever alive in you because you dwell in me.

Amen.

```
