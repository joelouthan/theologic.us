Most of my life was living and dwelling in shame. And I have tried to live my life of shame without God.

And that was horrible and terrible. I have done things for most of my adult life that I was so ashamed because I knew nothing but shame. I had a crippling porn addiction, two failed marriages, and kids that I don't get to see all the time.

I was so embarrassed and ashamed of my life. When it came down to it, I was nothing but a weak, pathetic shell of a man who wasn’t good for anything other than sexual pleasure at the hands of a pervert. When I was a kid, I was molested and made to do things I never wanted to do. And when I became just a little older, I threw myself into the darkness of hell and sin of porn because that was the only world I have ever known. 

I didn’t just watch porn or looked at porn; I collected it. Organized it. I made sure I would try my best to work to produce the best porn. It started with nude models. But as porn always does, it quickly degenerated into all of porn and everything that was included.

I am so ashamed of that. I am so ashamed of my past. I am so ashamed of my life.

And when I have reached out for help, no one thought I was worthy enough to help out. And no one on this earth came to my rescue.

The strong sense of ending my life makes so much sense to me for most of my life because I thought I was worthless. And even though I know God loves me and cares for me, that made ending my life all the more tempting—because at least I would be with my Savior forever.

But ending my life, no matter how dark I get, is not redemption, and it is not grace. Not in God’s eyes.

And even at the height of my shame when I attempted to take my life in front of my then-wife, my son, and my stepson, when I just wanted all the madness and confusion to end, and I just wanted the circle of sin and despair to end with my life, I still don’t know how that chef’s knife did not pierce my neck. I felt the point of the blade press into my aorta and the skin bending to the pressure, but the skin did not break.

And I am ashamed that I have attempted to take my own life.

If my life ended, it would not have prevented my kids from being sinners just like me.
That is my shame.

And I can’t tell you how many times I daydreamed about going back in time and undoing the things I have done. But what am I going to do? Go back in time and stop my dad from molesting me? Do you think I was louder or told someone quicker or just fought more, I could have saved myself?

I live with that shame. But I couldn’t do anything about that.

And that is what real redemption is all about.

Redemption is not going back into the past and changing it all. Redemption is that I was molested, but I am not marked by that sin against me. Redemption is that I have dealt in pornography and have seen more porn than most people, and yet, I am not marked by that sin that I did.

I am not even marked by the sin of keeping my first two wives away from my heart. I am not marked by my divorces or the fact that my kids do not live with me. I am not marked by any sin committed against me by others or sins that I have done or the right things that I failed to do.

I am completely, definitely, perfectly marked and sealed by the Holy Spirit, out of the overflow of the grace, love, and mercy of God my Father through the bloodshed and broken body of His Son, my Lord Jesus Christ.
That is redemption. There is none greater.

And because of His work in me, I know and live in that actual truth more and more every day.

That means that I have to be in counseling. And until just a few weeks ago, I realize that I will be in counseling for the rest of my life. I wish I didn’t have to, but at least I get to go. And there is no shame in that.

That means that I will always pray for and continue to fight for my relationships with my wife, kids, friends, and mentors. I do not take anything for granted. If I do, it all comes undone. And there is no shame in that.

That means that I will still be triggered because of my PTSD. It might be a single word or the sound of hamburger frying. It doesn't make sense to anyone else but only to me. But by God's grace, he has me.

And ultimately, I am utterly dependent on my Lord Jesus Christ and the will of my Father. Every day, every second, every decision, everything that I do has to be done according to his will. Christ lived his life entirely within the will of His Father by the power of His Spirit. How can I do no less?

I still have to fight through all the crap and sin and hurt that I have caused. But I hope and pray to God that he would grant me repentance to turn away from what I have done and what was done to me and turn to him.
