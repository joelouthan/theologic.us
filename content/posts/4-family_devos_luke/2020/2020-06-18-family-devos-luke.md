## The Word of the Lord is Power

Luke 4:14–15 (CSB) Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity.  He was teaching in their synagogues, being praised by everyone. 

*How can we share the gospel and teach the Bible like Jesus?*

## The Word of the Lord Has Been Fulfilled

Luke 4:16–21 (CSB) He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. As usual, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.  The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written:

    The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
    because he has anointed me
    to preach good news to the poor.
    He has sent me
    to proclaim release
    to the captives
    and recovery of sight to the blind,
    to set free the oppressed,
    to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.

He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.  He began by saying to them, “Today as you listen, this Scripture has been fulfilled.”

Matthew 5:17–20 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.  For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished.  Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.

*What is the Old Testament really about?*

*Name the ways in which Christ fulfilled the Old Testament?*

## The Word of the Lord Cuts to the Heart

Luke 4:22–30 (CSB) They were all speaking well of him and were amazed by the gracious words that came from his mouth; yet they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”  Then he said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Doctor, heal yourself. What we’ve heard that took place in Capernaum, do here in your hometown also.’ ”  He also said, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.  But I say to you, there were certainly many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months while a great famine came over all the land.  Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them except a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.  And in the prophet Elisha’s time, there were many in Israel who had leprosy, and yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”  When they heard this, everyone in the synagogue was enraged.  They got up, drove him out of town, and brought him to the edge of the hill that their town was built on, intending to hurl him over the cliff.  But he passed right through the crowd and went on his way.

Isaiah 55:11 (CSB) so my word that comes from my mouth will not return to me empty, but it will accomplish what I please and will prosper in what I send it to do.”

Matthew 13:18–23 (CSB) “So listen to the parable of the sower:  When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path.  And the one sown on rocky ground—this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.  But he has no root and is short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.  Now the one sown among the thorns—this is one who hears the word, but the worries of this age and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.  But the one sown on the good ground—this is one who hears and understands the word, who does produce fruit and yields: some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”

*If we proclaim the good news to others, what should we expect to happen?*

## The Word of the Lord Cleanses Us From All Unrighteousness

Luke 4:31–37 (CSB) Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.  They were astonished at his teaching because his message had authority.  In the synagogue there was a man with an unclean demonic spirit who cried out with a loud voice,  “Leave us alone! What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”  But Jesus rebuked him and said, “Be silent and come out of him!” And throwing him down before them, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.  Amazement came over them all, and they were saying to one another, “What is this message? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”  And news about him began to go out to every place in the vicinity.

1 John 1:9 (CSB) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

*Does Jesus have power over sin? In what ways?*

*Does Jesus have power over demons? In what ways?*

*Does Jesus have power over your sin?*
