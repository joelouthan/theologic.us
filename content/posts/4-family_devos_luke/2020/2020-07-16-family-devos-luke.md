### Blessed Are The Poor

~~~text
Luke 6:20 (CSB) Then looking up at his disciples, he said: 
      Blessed are you who are poor, 
      because the kingdom of God is yours. 
~~~

*What do you think Christ meant by poor?*

Luke 17:5–6 (CSB) The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” 6 “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed,” the Lord said, “you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.

Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

*If we have just a little faith, will we still receive God? Do we still get God?*

### Blessed Are The Hungry

~~~text
Luke 6:21a (CSB) 
      Blessed are you who are hungry now, 
      because you will be filled.

Psalm 42:1 (CSB)
      As a deer longs for flowing streams, 
      so I long for you, God.

Revelation 7:15–17 (CSB)
      For this reason they are before the throne of God, 
      and they serve him day and night in his temple. 
      The one seated on the throne will shelter them: 
      16 They will no longer hunger; 
      they will no longer thirst; 
      the sun will no longer strike them, 
      nor will any scorching heat. 
      17 For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne 
      will shepherd them; 
      he will guide them to springs of the waters of life, 
      and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

Psalm 17:15 (CSB)
      But I will see your face in righteousness; 
      when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.
~~~

*Can you imagine never being hungry or thirst again?*

*Can you imagine never feeling pain or never being hurt again?*

*Can you imagine never being sad or lonely again?*

Ecclesiastes 3:11 (CSB) He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts, but no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end.

*Who can fill the loneliness, anger, bitterness, emptiness within our hearts?*

*What does God need to do with our hearts before He can step into it?*

### Blessed Are The Sad

      Blessed are you who weep now, 
      because you will laugh.

### Blessed Are The Hated

~~~text
Luke 6:22-23 (CSB)
      Blessed are you when people hate you, 
      when they exclude you, insult you, 
      and slander your name as evil 
      because of the Son of Man.

“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. Take note—your reward is great in heaven, for this is the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets.

### Curse of Sin

~~~text
Genesis 3:16–19 (CSB) He said to the woman: 
      I will intensify your labor pains; 
      you will bear children with painful effort. 
      Your desire will be for your husband, 
      yet he will rule over you. 
17 And he said to the man, “Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’: 
      The ground is cursed because of you. 
      You will eat from it by means of painful labor 
      all the days of your life. 
      18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, 
      and you will eat the plants of the field. 
      19 You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow 
      until you return to the ground, 
      since you were taken from it. 
      For you are dust, 
      and you will return to dust.”
~~~

*What is a curse?*

*Is a curse something that God does?*

*What are the effects of sin? Does God give us a way out of sin and back to him?*

Romans 6:23 (CSB) For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

### Woe to Those Who Are Comforted Not in God

      for you have received your comfort. 
~~~

*Where does all of our money come from?*

Matthew 5:45 (CSB) so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

*Should we put our security into the gifts that God give or into God himself?*

~~~text
Proverbs 30:8–9 (CSB)
      Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. 
      Give me neither poverty nor wealth; 
      feed me with the food I need. 
      9 Otherwise, I might have too much 
      and deny you, saying, “Who is the LORD?” 
      or I might have nothing and steal, 
      profaning the name of my God.
~~~

*How can we trust God more than the gifts of God?*

### Woe to Those Who Are Filled Not By God

~~~text
Luke 6:25a (CSB)
      25 Woe to you who are now full, 
      for you will be hungry. 

Psalm 22:26 (CSB)
      The humble will eat and be satisfied; 
      those who seek the LORD will praise him. 
      May your hearts live forever!

1 Peter 5:6 (CSB) Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the proper time,

### Woe to Those Whose Joy Does Not Come From God

~~~text
Luke 6:25b (CSB)
      Woe to you who are now laughing, 
      for you will mourn and weep.

Psalm 16:11 (CSB)
       You reveal the path of life to me; 
       in your presence is abundant joy; 
       at your right hand are eternal pleasures.
       
Psalm 30:5 (CSB)
      For his anger lasts only a moment, 
      but his favor, a lifetime. 
      Weeping may stay overnight, 
      but there is joy in the morning.
      
~~~

*How long does joy and happiness last when it comes from sin and wrongdoing? What happens with joy if comes from God? Even in sad times?*

*Can you be sad and have joy in God at the same time? Can you mourn and grieve and have the joy of the Lord? Can you be angry and have the joy of the Lord?*

### Woe to Those Who Say Things That God Didn't Say

~~~text
Luke 6:26 (CSB)
      26 Woe to you 
      when all people speak well of you,  
      for this is the way their ancestors
      used to treat the false prophets.

Jeremiah 8:11 (CSB)
      They have treated the brokenness 
      of my dear people superficially, 
      claiming, ‘Peace, peace,’ 
      when there is no peace.
~~~

*Why do we not say things that God did not say? Why is that so important?*

*If we lie, does that bring death to others or life to others?*

2 Corinthians 2:15–17 (CSB) For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 16 To some we are an aroma of death leading to death, but to others, an aroma of life leading to life. Who is adequate for these things? 17 For we do not market the word of God for profit like so many. On the contrary, we speak with sincerity in Christ, as from God and before God.
