## The Text

>Psalm 19 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims the work of his hands. 

><sup> 2  </sup>Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge. 

><sup> 3  </sup>There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard. 

><sup> 4  </sup>Their message has gone out to the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun. 

><sup> 5  </sup>It is like a bridegroom coming from his home; it rejoices like an athlete running a course. 

><sup> 6  </sup>It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat. 

><sup> 7  </sup>The instruction of the LORD is perfect, renewing one’s life; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise. 

><sup> 8  </sup>The precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up. 

><sup> 9  </sup>The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are reliable and altogether righteous. 

><sup> 10  </sup>They are more desirable than gold— than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey dripping from a honeycomb. 

><sup> 11  </sup>In addition, your servant is warned by them, and in keeping them there is an abundant reward. 

><sup> 12  </sup>Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults. 

><sup> 13  </sup>Moreover, keep your servant from willful sins; do not let them rule me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed from blatant rebellion. 

><sup> 14  </sup>May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.

## The Article

```text
The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.

We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man’s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.
