**Luke 1:8–10 Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.**

1 Corinthians 7:24 So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.

Colossians 3:17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

*Beyond reading the Bible, praying, singing, going to church--how can we worship God all the time?*
