## The Psalm

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are With Me
</div>

```text
The battles I have seen
The bloodshed upon my hands
The hurt I have caused
The wounds I have made
Was all of my actions.

I have been hurt too
And that does not make it right

I am sorry Lord
For the hurt I have caused.

Will you save me?

Will you give me a tender heart
To forgive others
And love others
And to seek reconcilation
and help heal others?

I am so sorry Lord
For all of my sins.

Make me like your Son
And turn my heart towards you.

Amen.
```
