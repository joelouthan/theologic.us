## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Bridegroom
</div>

```text
And now
  you are finished
  my Lord
  and now all the kingdoms
  power
  glory
  belong to you alone.

Yours is the kingdom
  and you are exalted above all.

Yours is the treasure
  for you alone
  are the rightful heir
  to all of Creation.

Be exalted, O God
  I shall worship you
  all of my days
  there is none like you.

Amen.
```
