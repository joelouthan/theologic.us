## The Psalm

>Psalm 96 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>Sing a new song to the LORD; let the whole earth sing to the LORD. 

><sup> 2  </sup>Sing to the LORD, bless his name; proclaim his salvation from day to day. 

><sup> 3  </sup>Declare his glory among the nations, his wondrous works among all peoples. 

><sup> 4  </sup>For the LORD is great and is highly praised; he is feared above all gods. 

><sup> 5  </sup>For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. 

><sup> 6  </sup>Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 

><sup> 8  </sup>Ascribe to the LORD the glory of his name; bring an offering and enter his courts. 

><sup> 9  </sup>Worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness; let the whole earth tremble before him. 

><sup> 10  </sup>Say among the nations, “The LORD reigns. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken. He judges the peoples fairly.” 

><sup> 11  </sup>Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea and all that fills it resound. 

><sup> 12  </sup>Let the fields and everything in them celebrate. Then all the trees of the forest will shout for joy 

><sup> 13  </sup>before the LORD, for he is coming— for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with his faithfulness.

```text
I will exhaust my breath
  I will give whatever I have
  I will deplete my resources
  I will squeeze my heart
  I will sacrifice my voice
  I will waste my life
  to search you out
  to testify of your goodness
  to glorify your holy name
  to proclaim your salvation
  to preach your word
  to sing your name
  to the everlasting
  you are my God
  forever
```
