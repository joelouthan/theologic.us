  My Great God,
</div>

How many times have you rescued me from not only eternal death but certain death and doom?

How many times have I sinned that did and did not lead to my death?

The answer is countless. The truth is infinite.

But yet, you are my great God and Savior! I have fallen into the abyssmal pit too many times to count. But because of your grace upon grace, you were deeper still! You placed your hands underneath my dead body and rose me up again.

I have walked through, no, lived in the valley of the shadow of death. But it was death&#8217;s stench that engulfed me but it was your sweet scent of your gospel because you are the lily of the valley.

Never cease to rescue me. I will fall infinitely times more. I will need you infinitely and once more.

Amen.
