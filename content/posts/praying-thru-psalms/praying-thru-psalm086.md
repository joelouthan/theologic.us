## The Psalm
>Psalm 86 (CSB)  
> A prayer of David. 

><sup> 1 </sup> Listen, LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. 

><sup> 2 </sup> Protect my life, for I am faithful. You are my God; save your servant who trusts in you. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Be gracious to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Bring joy to your servantâ€™s life, because I appeal to you, Lord. 

><sup> 5 </sup> For you, Lord, are kind and ready to forgive, abounding in faithful love to all who call on you. 

><sup> 6 </sup> LORD, hear my prayer; listen to my cries for mercy. 

><sup> 7 </sup> I call on you in the day of my distress, for you will answer me. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Lord, there is no one like you among the gods, and there are no works like yours. 

><sup> 9 </sup> All the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, Lord, and will honor your name. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For you are great and perform wonders; you alone are God. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Teach me your way, LORD, and I will live by your truth. Give me an undivided mind to fear your name. 

><sup> 12 </sup> I will praise you with all my heart, Lord my God, and will honor your name forever. 

><sup> 13 </sup> For your faithful love for me is great, and you rescue my life from the depths of Sheol. 

><sup> 14 </sup> God, arrogant people have attacked me; a gang of ruthless men intends to kill me. They do not let you guide them. 

><sup> 15 </sup> But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give your strength to your servant; save the son of your female servant. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Show me a sign of your goodness; my enemies will see and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped and comforted me.

```text
You have been my God
  since my birth
  you have protected me
  from the attacks of the world
  you have shielded me
  from the attacks of the enemy

Moreso
  you have been my shelter
  when I had no roof
  you have been my tower
  when I was in constant danger
  you have been my hope
  when I was drowning in despair
  you have been my home
  when I had no one who loved me
  you have been my God
  when my idols have destroyed me.

In my life and love and heart and strength,
  I will glorify you for all of my days
  You are my sweetest King
  and one day, I will rest in your throne room
  to worship you
  and to look upon your lovely face
  for all of my days.

Thank you, my God and Protector.

Amen.
