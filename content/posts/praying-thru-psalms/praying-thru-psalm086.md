## The Psalms

><sup> 1 </sup> Listen, LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. 

><sup> 2 </sup> Protect my life, for I am faithful. You are my God; save your servant who trusts in you. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Be gracious to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Bring joy to your servantâ€™s life, because I appeal to you, Lord. 

><sup> 5 </sup> For you, Lord, are kind and ready to forgive, abounding in faithful love to all who call on you. 

><sup> 6 </sup> LORD, hear my prayer; listen to my cries for mercy. 

><sup> 7 </sup> I call on you in the day of my distress, for you will answer me. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Lord, there is no one like you among the gods, and there are no works like yours. 

><sup> 9 </sup> All the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, Lord, and will honor your name. 

><sup> 10 </sup> For you are great and perform wonders; you alone are God. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Teach me your way, LORD, and I will live by your truth. Give me an undivided mind to fear your name. 

><sup> 12 </sup> I will praise you with all my heart, Lord my God, and will honor your name forever. 

><sup> 13 </sup> For your faithful love for me is great, and you rescue my life from the depths of Sheol. 

><sup> 14 </sup> God, arrogant people have attacked me; a gang of ruthless men intends to kill me. They do not let you guide them. 

><sup> 15 </sup> But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give your strength to your servant; save the son of your female servant. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Show me a sign of your goodness; my enemies will see and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped and comforted me.
