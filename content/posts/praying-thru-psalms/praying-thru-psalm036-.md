```text
How often do I preach
  against the sin in others
  guilt deep in the hearts of men
  and as they continue to plot in vain
  as if there is no God.

But my life
  was filled to the hilt
  with my own wickedness
  perversions that few can know
  evil that cause some to shudder
  sin that churns and burns in my
  heart
  mind
  and soul
  continuously.

I was one of these worthless men
  that sinned all the more
  I was ill-deserving of any leniency
  I could not afford grace.

But you O Lord
  had me in your sights
  and you had sweetest mercy for me
  and you pulled me out of hell
  and your rescued me from death
  and you loved me
  and you saved me
  and you bless me.

My God, keep your hand on my life
  and keep turning my heart towards you.

Amen.
```
