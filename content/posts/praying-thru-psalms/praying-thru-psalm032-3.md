## The Prayer

```text
Without you,
  I am completely ignorant of you.

There are not enough classes in the world
  to sit and learn about you.

There are not enough books
  to sit and read to know you.

All the data in the world
  multiplied one billion fold
  couldn't even contain 
  what the Son has done
  what the Father has thought
  let alone how You move.

All knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
  philosophies, logic, reason
  science, medicine, and technology
  comes from you
  and is all your own.

More so
  to even see your glory
  to even call upon your name
  to even pray to you
  to be saved by you
  that sheer ability and knowledge
  you will need to give that to us first.

We are dead in our trespasses
  and dead men do not cry out
  Dead men do not think
  Dead men cannot pray
  Dead men cannot worship
  unless you give them life.

Uncover our eyes
  open our ears
  change our minds
  unmute our tongues
  exchange our hearts
  and make Your place
  into our souls.

Mark us
  seal us
  unto the Father.

Praise your holy name.
```
