<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My Lord,
</div>

```text
I am set apart, this is true. But set apart by you to you.

I reach out to the world, plead to the world, and with the Spirit, invite the world to come into Your loving embrace.

Few do. Many do not.

How can I respond?

You are my Lord above. You are my King on high. All things, both spiritual and material, are yours. All truth and all philosophies are under your sovereign hand. All lives and minds are under your rightful rulership.

You have set me apart not because of my own goodness but because of the goodness you have given me. You have set me apart and now I am in your safe arms forever. I finally see that you have set me apart in order to keep me safe from your wrath.

Be glorious in my life. Give me courage to proclaim your sweet name. Move me to be more of your of sweet aroma to those being saved and to those perishing.

Amen.
```
