## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
God of my little belief
</div>

```text
Oh how many times, O Lord,
  have I whispered nothings
  gave half-hearted thanks
  prayed and did not believe
  spoke and did not think it was real.

When I was an ungodly husband
  and my weak non-prayers were unanswered
  When I was a sinful subject
  and any other king would ignore me
  or worse yet
  have me executed
  for high treason?

But that is not you.

You are the King who sends his heralds
  to tell the nations
  about the good news
  that the God of the universe
  relentlessly
  passionately
  persistently
  wonderfully
  goes after us.
  Even those of us
  who are the most vile
  most wicked
  the chief of sinners
  like me.

You rescued me
  you called on me
  I call on you.
  You turn your ear to me
  because I am your son
  because of Your Son
  because of Your Spirit within me
  becasue you love me.

Be exalted, O Lord.
Be exalted higher and higher.
```
