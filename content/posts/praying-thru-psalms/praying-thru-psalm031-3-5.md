><sup>3</sup> For you are my rock and my fortress; you lead and guide me for your name’s sake.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Only Incomparable</div>

```text
Who is like you, God?

And who would compare to you?

You are my everything

And since birth, you have protected me
  you have guided me
  even when I wanted to run away
  you have always brought be back home.

**You have not abandoned me to hell**
  even when the world the discarded me as trash
  and everybody has despised me
  and Satan has come to destroyed me
  and his demons keep me in disarray
  and my own sin defiles me

But you, O Lord, are my heart's desire
  and I long to worship you.

Be with me.

Declare me to the holy
  and do not let me see corruption.

For you have shown me
  guided me
  and walked with me
  on Your path
  and now I am fully alive.

One blessed day,
  I will hold your face in my hands
  and kiss you with a thousand kisses
  and you will fill me with such great joy
  and I will sit at your right hand
  and be eternally
  completely
  perfectly
  blessed
  forevermore.


```
