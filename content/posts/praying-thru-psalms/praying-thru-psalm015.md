## The Psalm

>Psalm 15 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> LORD, who can dwell in your tent? Who can live on your holy mountain? 

><sup>2</sup> The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart— 

><sup>3</sup> who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor, 

><sup>4</sup> who despises the one rejected by the LORD but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his word whatever the cost, 

><sup>5</sup> who does not lend his silver at interest or take a bribe against the innocent— the one who does these things will never be shaken.

## The Prayer

  O Lord,

How could I possibly worship you? I am not worthy to commune with you and be with you. I sin even now. My heart strays. My soul wanders.

Yet, you, O God, are not far from me. When I am in the wilderness, you are closer than a whisper. When I have fallen, you set me back up on solid ground and you rejoice over me with singing. When I ran away from you, you sent your Son to live the life I could not live and die in my place for my sins.

Worthiness is not a feeling. Worthiness is an absolute truth.

You have justified me because I trust your Son.
You have given me your Son’s righteousness because He received my sin.
You have declared me to be holy because You alone are holy.
You have marked me as worthy because of the infinite worth of your Son.

I am my Beloved’s and He is mine. Forevermore.

Let me worship you. Let my life be marked in praise to Your holy name. Let my very breath be a sweet sound in your ears.

I love you, God.

In name of Your mighty Son, I pray.
Amen.
