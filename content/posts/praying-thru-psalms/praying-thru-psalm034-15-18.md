## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Life and Heart
</div>

```text
Why would you spare me?

I have seen the evil that men have done
  I have seen their sins stacked up
  miles above
  oceans deep
  filling the earth
  with treachery and debauchery

My sins filled more
  overfill all oceans and canyons
  I have done more evil in your sight
  than all of humanity
  I am the supreme chief of sinners

But yet
  you saw me
  not the good that I could ever do
  but the wickedness that was in me
  and you pitied me
  because I was a fool
  and you sought me
  because I was lost
  and you loved me
  because I was completely unlovable

When I saw your glory
  from the deepest, darkest parts of my heart
  I cried out in agony and pain,
  "HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER!"

And your sweetest, only begotten Son
  laid his mighty hand on me
  and quietly respond,
  "I do not condemn you"

Now, only because of You
  that I will go
  and sin no more.

Praise be to your loveliest name.
```
