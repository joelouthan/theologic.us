## The Psalm

>Psalm 58 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Do you really speak righteously, you mighty ones? Do you judge people fairly? 

><sup>2</sup> No, you practice injustice in your hearts; with your hands you weigh out violence in the land. 

><sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb; liars wander about from birth. 

><sup>4</sup> They have venom like the venom of a snake, like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears, 

><sup>5</sup> that does not listen to the sound of the charmers who skillfully weave spells. 

><sup>6</sup> God, knock the teeth out of their mouths; LORD, tear out the young lions’ fangs. 

><sup>7</sup> May they vanish like water that flows by; may they aim their blunted arrows. 

><sup>8</sup> Like a slug that moves along in slime, like a woman’s miscarried child, may they not see the sun. 

><sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns— whether green or burning— he will sweep them away. 

><sup>10</sup> The righteous one will rejoice when he sees the retribution; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

><sup>11</sup> Then people will say, “Yes, there is a reward for the righteous! There is a God who judges on earth!”

You Are My Quick Answer

```text
No matter what has happened to me
For I have been
molested
raped
left to starve
kidnapped
Held for hostage
Homeless
Loveless
Orphan
Lost
Divorced
Twice
Lost my kids
Lost my jobs
Lost my friends
And my homes.

I am sinner
filled with lust
worked in porn
stolen
cheated
lied
lazy
full of rage
Filled with wrath
Filled with pride
Hater of everyone
Hater of women
Hater of self.

Yet,
I am not those things.
Because you saw me 
Before time began
And you loved me
And you set your affections 
Upon me
And because you sent your Son
Who lived for me
Who bled, hung, and died for me
Who ascended to your right hand for me
Who sent His Spirit for me.

You are my identity.
I identified with you.

Nothing I have done
Or anything that has happened to me
Not my circumstances
Nor my deeds
just you
My Lord and my King.

Amen.
```
