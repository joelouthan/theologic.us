## The Psalm

>Psalm 35:4â€“6 (CSB)  
><sup>4</sup> Let those who intend to take my life be disgraced and humiliated; let those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed. 

><sup>5</sup> Let them be like chaff in the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away. 

><sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Conquering God
</div>

```text
You descended to the cross
  with great joy.

You faced Death
  and called out Life

You bear the weight
  of my complete sin

You gave yourself over
  and allowed them
  to nail you
  to the cross

They mocked
  others grieved.
  your heart was pierced
  your love washed over
  your body broken
  your Spirit remained
  until the justified wrath of God
  was meant for me
  was finished pouring on you

When you cried out,
  "IT IS FINISHED!"
  when your Spirit left
  when your breath exhausted
  at that very moment
  you snapped the neck of Death
  the realms of Hell became yours
  my sin was removed infinitely away
  demons cried out in pain
  and Satan
  the Prince of Lies
  the Condemner of Man
  the Fallen Angel
  was conquered
  stripped of his power
  put to open shame
  forever.

And all the angels bear witness,
  Worthy is the Lamb that was just slain, 
  Holy
  Holy
  Holy
  is the Lord God Almighty
  who was
  and is
  and is to come.

Amen.
```
