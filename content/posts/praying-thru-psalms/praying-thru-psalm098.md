## The Psalm

>Psalm 98 (CSB)  
> A psalm. 

><sup> 1  </sup>Sing a new song to the LORD, for he has performed wonders; his right hand and holy arm have won him victory. 

><sup> 2  </sup>The LORD has made his victory known; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 

><sup> 3  </sup>He has remembered his love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen our God’s victory. 

><sup> 4  </sup>Let the whole earth shout to the LORD; be jubilant, shout for joy, and sing. 

><sup> 5  </sup>Sing to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and melodious song. 

><sup> 6  </sup>With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout triumphantly in the presence of the LORD, our King. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Let the sea and all that fills it, the world and those who live in it, resound. 

><sup> 8  </sup>Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains shout together for joy 

><sup> 9  </sup>before the LORD, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world righteously and the peoples fairly.

I remember
  within this year
  how I sinned against you
  and trespass your holy name

What did you do
  what was your response?

You took my top prayers
  and in your beauty might
  and answered them one by one

I sinned against you
  you saved my oldest son

I war against you
  you dwelled in the heart of my youngest son

I blasphemed you
  but you were faithful to my children

I sought out deceit 
  and yet, you let me
  preach your holy word

Is there no end to you mercies to me?

Is there no limit to your grace that you have stacked upon grace for me?

Is there no space that can contain your tenderness for me?

From what I have seen
  and I have experienced
  and I know
  that if I took your love to me
  and poured into the universe
  you would have infinite more love
  just for me

I will praise your holy name
  because you are my great God
