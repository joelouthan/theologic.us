## The Psalms

>Psalm 98 (CSB)  
> A psalm. 

><sup> 1  </sup>Sing a new song to the LORD, for he has performed wonders; his right hand and holy arm have won him victory. 

><sup> 2  </sup>The LORD has made his victory known; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 

><sup> 3  </sup>He has remembered his love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen our God’s victory. 

><sup> 4  </sup>Let the whole earth shout to the LORD; be jubilant, shout for joy, and sing. 

><sup> 5  </sup>Sing to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and melodious song. 

><sup> 6  </sup>With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout triumphantly in the presence of the LORD, our King. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Let the sea and all that fills it, the world and those who live in it, resound. 

><sup> 8  </sup>Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains shout together for joy 

><sup> 9  </sup>before the LORD, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world righteously and the peoples fairly.
