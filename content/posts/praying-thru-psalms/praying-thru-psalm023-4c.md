<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
My Lord and my God,
</div>

```text
Even when I was dead,
  you called my name.

Even when I was lost,
  you found me.

Even when I was blind,
  you touched my eyes
  and opened them to see.

Even when I was deaf,
  you opened them to hear.

Even when I was hard-hearted,
  you took my heart of stone
  and gave me your tender heart.

Even when I couldnâ€™t know you,
  you gave me Your Spirit.

Even when I am in the wilderness,
  you are closer to me than a whisper.

You are my God. I will adore
and worship you forever.
  
```
