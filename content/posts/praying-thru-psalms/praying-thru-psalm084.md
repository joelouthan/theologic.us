## The Psalms

>Psalm 84 (CSB)
>For the choir director: on the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

><sup> 1 </sup> How lovely is your dwelling place, LORD of Armies. 

><sup> 2 </sup> I long and yearn for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Even a sparrow finds a home, and a swallow, a nest for herself where she places her youngâ€” near your altars, LORD of Armies, my King and my God. 

><sup> 4 </sup> How happy are those who reside in your house, who praise you continually. Selah 

><sup> 5 </sup> Happy are the people whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 

><sup> 6 </sup> As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a source of spring water; even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings. 

><sup> 7 </sup> They go from strength to strength; each appears before God in Zion. 

><sup> 8 </sup> LORD God of Armies, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob. Selah 

><sup> 9 </sup> Consider our shield, God; look on the face of your anointed one. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Better a day in your courts than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than live in the tents of wicked people. 

><sup> 11 </sup> For the LORD God is a sun and shield. The LORD grants favor and honor; he does not withhold the good from those who live with integrity. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Happy is the person who trusts in you, LORD of Armies!
