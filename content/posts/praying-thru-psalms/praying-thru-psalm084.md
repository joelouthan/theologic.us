## The Psalm

>Psalm 84 (CSB)
>For the choir director: on the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

><sup> 1 </sup> How lovely is your dwelling place, LORD of Armies. 

><sup> 2 </sup> I long and yearn for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Even a sparrow finds a home, and a swallow, a nest for herself where she places her youngâ€” near your altars, LORD of Armies, my King and my God. 

><sup> 4 </sup> How happy are those who reside in your house, who praise you continually. Selah 

><sup> 5 </sup> Happy are the people whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 

><sup> 6 </sup> As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a source of spring water; even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings. 

><sup> 7 </sup> They go from strength to strength; each appears before God in Zion. 

><sup> 8 </sup> LORD God of Armies, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob. Selah 

><sup> 9 </sup> Consider our shield, God; look on the face of your anointed one. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Better a day in your courts than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than live in the tents of wicked people. 

><sup> 11 </sup> For the LORD God is a sun and shield. The LORD grants favor and honor; he does not withhold the good from those who live with integrity. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Happy is the person who trusts in you, LORD of Armies!

You are my joy
  my haven
  my safe place
  my comfort in my desperate time of need.

You are the only place
  I can go to
  when I am hurt
  lonely
  scared
  ashamed
  cold
  and you will bring me in
  bring me close to your heart
  and let me heal and be restored
  and cared for and soothed
  all the days of my life.

You are my great God in heaven
  I will forever praise your holy name.
```
