## The Psalm

>Psalm 55 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. 

><sup>1</sup> God, listen to my prayer and do not hide from my plea for help. 

><sup>2</sup> Pay attention to me and answer me. I am restless and in turmoil with my complaint, 

><sup>3</sup> because of the enemy’s words, because of the pressure of the wicked. For they bring down disaster on me and harass me in anger. 

><sup>4</sup> My heart shudders within me; terrors of death sweep over me. 

><sup>5</sup> Fear and trembling grip me; horror has overwhelmed me. 

><sup>6</sup> I said, “If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest. 

><sup>7</sup> How far away I would flee; I would stay in the wilderness. Selah 

><sup>8</sup> I would hurry to my shelter from the raging wind and the storm.” 

><sup>9</sup> Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city; 

><sup>10</sup> day and night they make the rounds on its walls. Crime and trouble are within it; 

><sup>11</sup> destruction is inside it; oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace. 

><sup>12</sup> Now it is not an enemy who insults me— otherwise I could bear it; it is not a foe who rises up against me— otherwise I could hide from him. 

><sup>13</sup> But it is you, a man who is my peer, my companion and good friend! 

><sup>14</sup> We used to have close fellowship; we walked with the crowd into the house of God. 

><sup>15</sup> Let death take them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, because evil is in their homes and within them. 

><sup>16</sup> But I call to God, and the LORD will save me. 

><sup>17</sup> I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and he hears my voice. 

><sup>18</sup> Though many are against me, he will redeem me from my battle unharmed. 

><sup>19</sup> God, the one enthroned from long ago, will hear and will humiliate them Selah because they do not change and do not fear God. 

><sup>20</sup> My friend acts violently against those at peace with him; he violates his covenant. 

><sup>21</sup> His buttery words are smooth, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords. 

><sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never allow the righteous to be shaken. 

><sup>23</sup> God, you will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and treachery will not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Help
</div>

```text
I don't pretend to understand
Or can even teach
Or comprehend
Why you would answer my prayers.

But just like those in the Bible,
I called on you
And you answered
And you rescued me.

Sometimes I will pray
And you will not answer my questions
I have taken that to mean
I will wait upon the Lord
Because you alone are my refuge and strength
My portion
My help in my very hour of need.

I have seen the faith of my grandmother
Who prayed for you to save my dad
And you did!

And I have seen my grandmother
Pray for you to save me
and you did!

I know you alone are mighty to save
Because salvation belongs to you.

Save me
Save my children
Save my household
Save their households

Lord,

Save us all
So that together
We can worship you.

Be my God.

Amen.
```
