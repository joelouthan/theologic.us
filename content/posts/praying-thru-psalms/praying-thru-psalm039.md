The King of my Soul,
</div>

```text
In fury,
  wrath
  injustice
  vengeance
  rage
  and anger
  I cried out
  not in righteousness of your Son
  but if I examine my heart for a second
  in my own self-righteousness

I share
  posts
  memes
  quotes
  to try to take away the pain
  when I should have been grieving
  crying
  interceding
  and praying
  because you have saw our iniquity
  and you have withheld your mercy
  and you have judged our land
  unholy and unpleasing
  to you.

My God,
  make me ready
  for what you are about to do
  make me ready
  to be taken in by you
  make me ready
  so that your Son will come back
  now
  today
  right now
  so that i can be with you

Every person
  that I have ever come across
  save them
  save them now
  save them quickly
  do not hesitate
  strip their pride
  crack their heart open
  step into their eternity
  and predestined to you
  the only and only God
  who alone is mighty to save

Save them Lord
  Save them to the utmost
  Save them now.
  Take us home.
  None of us are waiting for anything worthwhile
  because nothing that we could ever desire
  compares to you

We need you
  desperately
  right now

Come Lord Jesus.
  Come quickly
  Amen and amen
```
