## The Psalm

>Psalm 39 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> I said, “I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are in my presence.” 

><sup>2</sup> I was speechless and quiet; I kept silent, even from speaking good, and my pain intensified. 

><sup>3</sup> My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, a fire burned. I spoke with my tongue: 

><sup>4</sup> “LORD, make me aware of my end and the number of my days so that I will know how short-lived I am. 

><sup>5</sup> In fact, you have made my days just inches long, and my life span is as nothing to you. Yes, every human being stands as only a vapor. Selah 

><sup>6</sup> Yes, a person goes about like a mere shadow. Indeed, they rush around in vain, gathering possessions without knowing who will get them. 

><sup>7</sup> “Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you. 

><sup>8</sup> Rescue me from all my transgressions; do not make me the taunt of fools. 

><sup>9</sup> I am speechless; I do not open my mouth because of what you have done. 

><sup>10</sup> Remove your torment from me. Because of the force of your hand I am finished. 

><sup>11</sup> You discipline a person with punishment for iniquity, consuming like a moth what is precious to him; yes, every human being is only a vapor. Selah 

><sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, LORD, and listen to my cry for help; do not be silent at my tears. For I am here with you as an alien, a temporary resident like all my ancestors. 

><sup>13</sup> Turn your angry gaze from me so that I may be cheered up before I die and am gone.”

## The Prayer

The King of my Soul,

```text
In fury,
  wrath
  injustice
  vengeance
  rage
  and anger
  I cried out
  not in righteousness of your Son
  but if I examine my heart for a second
  in my own self-righteousness

I share
  posts
  memes
  quotes
  to try to take away the pain
  when I should have been grieving
  crying
  interceding
  and praying
  because you have saw our iniquity
  and you have withheld your mercy
  and you have judged our land
  unholy and unpleasing
  to you.

My God,
  make me ready
  for what you are about to do
  make me ready
  to be taken in by you
  make me ready
  so that your Son will come back
  now
  today
  right now
  so that i can be with you

Every person
  that I have ever come across
  save them
  save them now
  save them quickly
  do not hesitate
  strip their pride
  crack their heart open
  step into their eternity
  and predestined to you
  the only and only God
  who alone is mighty to save

Save them Lord
  Save them to the utmost
  Save them now.
  Take us home.
  None of us are waiting for anything worthwhile
  because nothing that we could ever desire
  compares to you

We need you
  desperately
  right now

Come Lord Jesus.
  Come quickly
  Amen and amen
```
