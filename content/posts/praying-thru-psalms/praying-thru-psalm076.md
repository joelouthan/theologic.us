## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Righteous
</div>

```text
When I joined the rest of the world
  to make war with you
  I sit tight
  under your mighty wraith
  with every beat of my heart
  because my heart knew nothing else
  but wickedness and deceit towards you.

What I could never foreknew
  is that before the mountains were formed
  and time and space were spoken into existence
  from everlasting to everlasting
  you have sat your affections on me
  and you bended time and circumstances
  and you broke into our broken world
  by the way of your Son
  so that he would live and die for me
  so that my sins--all of my wicked sins
  would be buried in that tomb
  and I would be resurrected
  not just in life
  but true life
  forevermore.

Do what you must
  to keep me close to you.
  I never want to be apart from you
  because that is a hell
  I never want to see again.

Amen.
```
