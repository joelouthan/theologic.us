## The Prayer

The Absolute Longings of my Heart
</div>

```text
My God
  I have suffered so much due
  to all the sin I’ve committed
  all the righteous acts that I have failed to do 
  and all the wickedness done to me.

I was destined to die
  I was limited to this world
  and it’s smallish pleasures
  that fulfill nothing
  in my eternal heart.

And because I am a son of Adam
  I feared only everything not Godx
  My attention was away from you
  My gaze was away from your face
  My heart flees from you

Capture my heart
  Again and again

Capture my love
  until I know no other love

Capture my life
  until you take me home forever

Tell me your will
  so I can do it

Tell me your heart
  so I can see if my heart matches
  and repent if not

Tell me I am yours forever
  so I can be alive 
  and free in you

Praise your holy name forever
```
