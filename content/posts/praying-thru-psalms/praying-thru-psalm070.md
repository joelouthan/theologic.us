## The Psalm


## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Rescuer
</div>

```text
How many times
  do I fall back into the depths of the ocean
  to drown in my own sin
  to return back to my vomit
  to die another death
  to run away from you?

  How many times
    do you love me
    do you care for me
    do you keep me
    do you find me
    do you rescue me

How many stars are there?

How many grains of sand?

How many drops of ocean?

How many blades of grass?

How many waves of sun?

What is that number?

Doesn't compare
  to your unending love for me.

Amen.
```
