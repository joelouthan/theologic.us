## The Psalms

>Psalm 4 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, God, who vindicates me. You freed me from affliction; be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 

><sup>2</sup> How long, exalted ones, will my honor be insulted? How long will you love what is worthless and pursue a lie? Selah 

><sup>3</sup> Know that the LORD has set apart the faithful for himself; the LORD will hear when I call to him. 

><sup>4</sup> Be angry and do not sin; reflect in your heart while on your bed and be silent. Selah 

><sup>5</sup> Offer sacrifices in righteousness and trust in the LORD. 

><sup>6</sup> Many are asking, “Who can show us anything good?” Let the light of your face shine on us, LORD. 

><sup>7</sup> You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and new wine abound. 

><sup>8</sup> I will both lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, LORD, make me live in safety.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  Dear God,
</div>

Help!

You have helped me in the past and this time I still need you.

I have dismissed all the lies around me.

I still need you.
I still need your love.
I still need your mercy.
I still need your grace.

Give me your hand.
I need to feel your embrace.
I need to feel your warmth.
I know you are always with me.

Right now, I will lay in peace.

Because you are with me.

Selah.
```
