## The Psalm

>Psalm 37 (CSB)  
><sup>4</sup> Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you your heartâ€™s desires. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The Only Holder of My Heart
</div>

```text
I have one prayer:
  give me your heart.
  for mine is frail and weak
  and corrupted with sin.
  it is made of stone
  and gives me no life
  it gives wickedness
  and seeks to only destroy me.

If I had your heart,
  surely I will live
  surely I will be in your grace
  surely I will give others your grace
  I will see others in the a new light
  that you love them with all of your heart
  and your desire was to save them

Grant me a new heart, O Lord
  then my desires will not be for this world
  but for they will be for you alone.

Be my love.

Be my joy.

Be my king.

You are my God.

I love you.

Amen.
```
