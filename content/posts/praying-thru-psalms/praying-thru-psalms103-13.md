## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
I have one thing to say

I see my love and my affections
  swell for you
  and all I want more 
  than anything
  is to see your face
  and be with you.

This
  that you have done in me
  could only be you
  thank you
  my God.

Amen.
```
