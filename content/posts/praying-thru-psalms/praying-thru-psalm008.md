## The Psalm

>Psalm 8 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: on the Gittith. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth! You have covered the heavens with your majesty. 

><sup>2</sup> From the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have established a stronghold on account of your adversaries in order to silence the enemy and the avenger. 

><sup>3</sup> When I observe your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you set in place, 

><sup>4</sup> what is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him? 

><sup>5</sup> You made him little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor. 

><sup>6</sup> You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet: 

><sup>7</sup> all the sheep and oxen, as well as the animals in the wild, 

><sup>8</sup> the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea that pass through the currents of the seas. 

><sup>9</sup> LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My Lord, Our Lord,
</div>

```text
Your name is known throughout all the earth.
Your fame knows no bounds.
Your glory will not be given to another.
Your love is simply unmatched.

And who you are and what you do is not determined and defined by the world around me. You are defined by your thoughts, your mind, your heart, and upon your revelation alone. I ask not for you to reveal more than what you have already reveal for my mind and soul and heart can barely comprehend your fullness now.

I can barely hold on to the grace that you have given me. Â But even in that holding on is grace upon grace. For that, I thank you.

You are God of the heavens, space, galaxies, and solar systems. You rule above it all. You are King and Lord over all kings and lords.

But you know me. Not just of me, but you know me. You know me and you love me.

You loved me enough to leave your throne, to leave your heavenly home, away from the Father, Spirit, and the heavenly hosts to come and get me. You rescued me from the uttermost depths of the oceans. You have retrieved me from the lips of the mouth of hell. You have saved me from death. You have loved me to bring me to you.
God, I love you. For all of my life and all of eternity, I will forever proclaim your glorious name. I love you. Thank you.

In your name, I pray.
Amen.
