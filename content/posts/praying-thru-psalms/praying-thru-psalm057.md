You Are My Protector
</div>
 
```text
I have been surrounded by evil
Left exposed
And vulnerable
To Satan and Demons
Who feed upon my flesh
And leave me to perish.

My God
How did you know
Where I needed help
How could you love 
Someone like me
I have been unloved and unwanted
All of my life
But you came along
And brought me to you
And kept me in your heart.

I have fought with you
But you stayed with me
I have warred against you
And you love me regardless
I have ran away
Yet you were there to rescue me
All the days of my life.

You have always been with me
From my mother's womb
Till I see you.

You are forever
My Lord and King.

Amen.
```
