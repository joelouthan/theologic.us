## The Psalm

>Psalm 57 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. When he fled before Saul into the cave. 

><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, for I take refuge in you. I will seek refuge in the shadow of your wings until danger passes. 

><sup>2</sup> I call to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me. 

><sup>3</sup> He reaches down from heaven and saves me, challenging the one who tramples me. Selah God sends his faithful love and truth. 

><sup>4</sup> I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among devouring lions— people whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. 

><sup>5</sup> God, be exalted above the heavens; let your glory be over the whole earth. 

><sup>6</sup> They prepared a net for my steps; I was despondent. They dug a pit ahead of me, but they fell into it! Selah 

><sup>7</sup> My heart is confident, God, my heart is confident. I will sing; I will sing praises. 

><sup>8</sup> Wake up, my soul! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn. 

><sup>9</sup> I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 

><sup>10</sup> For your faithful love is as high as the heavens; your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 

><sup>11</sup> God, be exalted above the heavens; let your glory be over the whole earth.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Protector

```text
I have been surrounded by evil
Left exposed
And vulnerable
To Satan and Demons
Who feed upon my flesh
And leave me to perish.

My God
How did you know
Where I needed help
How could you love 
Someone like me
I have been unloved and unwanted
All of my life
But you came along
And brought me to you
And kept me in your heart.

I have fought with you
But you stayed with me
I have warred against you
And you love me regardless
I have ran away
Yet you were there to rescue me
All the days of my life.

You have always been with me
From my mother's womb
Till I see you.

You are forever
My Lord and King.

Amen.
```
