## The Psalm

>Psalm 101 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> I will sing of faithful love and justice; I will sing praise to you, LORD. 

><sup>2</sup> I will pay attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will live with a heart of integrity in my house. 

><sup>3</sup> I will not let anything worthless guide me. I hate the practice of transgression; it will not cling to me. 

><sup>4</sup> A devious heart will be far from me; I will not be involved with evil. 

><sup>5</sup> I will destroy anyone who secretly slanders his neighbor; I cannot tolerate anyone with haughty eyes or an arrogant heart. 

><sup>6</sup> My eyes favor the faithful of the land so that they may sit down with me. The one who follows the way of integrity may serve me. 

><sup>7</sup> No one who acts deceitfully will live in my palace; the one who tells lies will not be retained here to guide me. 

><sup>8</sup> Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, wiping out all evildoers from the LORDâ€™s city.

```text
You have picked me
  a cistern of destruction
  a vessel to rightfully receive your wrath

And instead you have made me
  a lamp of your grace
  a temple of your mercy
  a receiver of your compassion

Because
  the Spirit rests and dwells in me
  the Son lives in my heart
  the Father have made your home in me

For I will worship you
  all of my days
  because you have chosen me
  a man fit for destruction
  cleansed me and washed me
  and made me yours

For as long as you are with me
  I will forever be saved
  because your works are perfect
  your faithfulness is certain
  and your love is steadfast

I praise you for your mercy
  and kindness
  for all of my days

Amen
```
