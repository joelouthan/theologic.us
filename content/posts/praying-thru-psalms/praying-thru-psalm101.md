## The Psalm

>Psalm 101 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> I will sing of faithful love and justice; I will sing praise to you, LORD. 

><sup>2</sup> I will pay attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will live with a heart of integrity in my house. 

><sup>3</sup> I will not let anything worthless guide me. I hate the practice of transgression; it will not cling to me. 

><sup>4</sup> A devious heart will be far from me; I will not be involved with evil. 

><sup>5</sup> I will destroy anyone who secretly slanders his neighbor; I cannot tolerate anyone with haughty eyes or an arrogant heart. 

><sup>6</sup> My eyes favor the faithful of the land so that they may sit down with me. The one who follows the way of integrity may serve me. 

><sup>7</sup> No one who acts deceitfully will live in my palace; the one who tells lies will not be retained here to guide me. 

><sup>8</sup> Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, wiping out all evildoers from the LORDâ€™s city.
