## The Psalm

>Psalm 19 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims the work of his hands. 

><sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge. 

><sup>3</sup> There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard. 

><sup>4</sup> Their message has gone out to the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun. 

><sup>5</sup> It is like a bridegroom coming from his home; it rejoices like an athlete running a course. 

><sup>6</sup> It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat. 

><sup>7</sup> The instruction of the LORD is perfect, renewing one’s life; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise. 

><sup>8</sup> The precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up. 

><sup>9</sup> The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are reliable and altogether righteous. 

><sup>10</sup> They are more desirable than gold— than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey dripping from a honeycomb. 

><sup>11</sup> In addition, your servant is warned by them, and in keeping them there is an abundant reward. 

><sup>12</sup> Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults. 

><sup>13</sup> Moreover, keep your servant from willful sins; do not let them rule me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed from blatant rebellion. 

><sup>14</sup> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.

## The Prayer

  My God,

Yet, you transported from the spiritual to the material. You cut across space and time. You _personally_ opened my eyes, gave words for my throat, opened my eyes, filled my heart, and gave me understanding so that I may know you. You gave me rest for my soul, removed the curse from my tongue, made me your son and you glorified me.

You called out to me so that I might have life. You spoke to me because I am your friend. You whisper to me because you are always near to me.

Your words are without comparison. There is no other word that actually raised me from the dead. There is no other name by which I am saved. There is no other for you alone have the words to eternal life.

My Lord and God. My Savior. My Redeemer. My Father. My Christ. My Spirit.

My words still fall short. My heart is still so weak. But what little life I have and with what few words I  can say, let them be my worship to you.

I love you, Lord. With all that I am, I will forever bless your holy name.

Amen.
