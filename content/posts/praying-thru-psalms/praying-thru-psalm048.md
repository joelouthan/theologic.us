## The Psalm

>Psalm 48 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

><sup>1</sup> The LORD is great and highly praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain, 

><sup>2</sup> rising splendidly, is the joy of the whole earth. Mount Zion—the summit of Zaphon— is the city of the great King. 

><sup>3</sup> God is known as a stronghold in its citadels. 

><sup>4</sup> Look! The kings assembled; they advanced together. 

><sup>5</sup> They looked and froze with fear; they fled in terror. 

><sup>6</sup> Trembling seized them there, agony like that of a woman in labor, 

><sup>7</sup> as you wrecked the ships of Tarshish with the east wind. 

><sup>8</sup> Just as we heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Armies, in the city of our God; God will establish it forever. Selah 

><sup>9</sup> God, within your temple, we contemplate your faithful love. 

><sup>10</sup> Like your name, God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with justice. 

><sup>11</sup> Mount Zion is glad. Judah’s villages rejoice because of your judgments. 

><sup>12</sup> Go around Zion, encircle it; count its towers, 

><sup>13</sup> note its ramparts; tour its citadels so that you can tell a future generation: 

><sup>14</sup> “This God, our God forever and ever— he will always lead us.”

## The Prayer

You Are My Dwelling

```text
I have been surrounded
  by all iniquity
  temptation waits for me
  sin is drawing ever so closely.

The demons seek
  and wait for my moments of weakness
  which I am continuously frail
  surely I will be devoured.

Satan attempts one last time
  to destroy your son
  to crush me
  with the weight of my own sin
  surely I will be buried.

But you have appeared
  not just one time rescuer
  but the all-time destroyer of evil
  the everlasting protector
  the risen conquerer.

When I have fallen
  you have lifted my head
  when I am faithless
  you have been faithful
  when I am weak
  you are the Almighty God.

I will give you praise
  for all of my days
  because you alone
  are worthy of my praise.

King Jesus
