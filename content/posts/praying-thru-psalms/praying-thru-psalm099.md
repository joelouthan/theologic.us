## The Psalms

>Psalm 99 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The LORD reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He is enthroned between the cherubim. Let the earth quake. 

><sup> 2  </sup>The LORD is great in Zion; he is exalted above all the peoples. 

><sup> 3  </sup>Let them praise your great and awe-inspiring name. He is holy. 

><sup> 4  </sup>The mighty King loves justice. You have established fairness; you have administered justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

><sup> 5  </sup>Exalt the LORD our God; bow in worship at his footstool. He is holy. 

><sup> 6  </sup>Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also was among those calling on his name. They called to the LORD and he answered them. 

><sup> 7  </sup>He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept his decrees and the statutes he gave them. 

><sup> 8  </sup>LORD our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their sinful actions. 

><sup> 9  </sup>Exalt the LORD our God; bow in worship at his holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.
