## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O Lord</div>

```text
My enemies have been numerous,
  and they attack me relentless.
They do not rest when I am sleeping,
  they even attack me in my dreams.

My scars run deep,
  my bones break.
But you, O Lord, are my healer and my restorer.
  You sent your Son
  to care for the sick and wounded.
  Be attentive to my pain
  and I will rejoice before you.
You are the sweet love of my life forever.

Amen.
```
