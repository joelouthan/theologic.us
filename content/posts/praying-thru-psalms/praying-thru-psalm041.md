## The Psalm

>Psalm 41 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Happy is one who is considerate of the poor; the LORD will save him in a day of adversity. 

><sup>2</sup> The LORD will keep him and preserve him; he will be blessed in the land. You will not give him over to the desire of his enemies. 

><sup>3</sup> The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed; you will heal him on the bed where he lies. 

><sup>4</sup> I said, “LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you.” 

><sup>5</sup> My enemies speak maliciously about me: “When will he die and be forgotten?” 

><sup>6</sup> When one of them comes to visit, he speaks deceitfully; he stores up evil in his heart; he goes out and talks. 

><sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together about me; they plan to harm me. 

><sup>8</sup> “Something awful has overwhelmed him, and he won’t rise again from where he lies!” 

><sup>9</sup> Even my friend in whom I trusted, one who ate my bread, has raised his heel against me. 

><sup>10</sup> But you, LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up; then I will repay them. 

><sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. 

><sup>12</sup> You supported me because of my integrity and set me in your presence forever. 

><sup>13</sup> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.

## The Prayer

Savior of All

```text
I will guard my mouth
  and my heart
  to not speak ill
  of those who are in abundance
  who do as they seem what is right in their own eyes
  and live as there is no God

I pray for them
  that you quickly save them
  as I pray this prayer
  and say these words

O Lord,
  I need you to be gracious to me
  heal my broken heart
  for I continuously sin against you

I went about my days
  being worthless and foolish
  disobedient to all of your law
  deceived by the prince of the air
  enslaved by the lusts of my heart
  and the idols of my mind
  living in violent opposition to you
  hated by others
  and hating one another

But when you appeared to me
  on that rainy Monday afternoon
  when I just sinned against you
  you saved me
  I have done nothing righteous
  in your eyes
  but you alone where completely merciful to me
  and you exchanged my sin-filled cancerous granite heart for your tender soft heart
  and you washed me clean
  and you renewed me with your Spirit
  to whom there is no end

I bath in your Spirit
  because your Son spoken and gave me Him
  and now I am a wicked sinner
  justified by Your grace
  and now I am an adopted child
  who now inherits everything
  that you gave your Son

Be exalted, my God

Be exalted, higher and higher

Amen
```
