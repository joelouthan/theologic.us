## The Psalm

>Psalm 53 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: on Mahalath. A Maskil of David. 

><sup>1</sup> The fool says in his heart, “There’s no God.” They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good. 

><sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God. 

><sup>3</sup> All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one. 

><sup>4</sup> Will evildoers never understand? They consume my people as they consume bread; they do not call on God. 

><sup>5</sup> Then they will be filled with dread— dread like no other— because God will scatter the bones of those who besiege you. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them. 

><sup>6</sup> Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.

You Are My Mercy

```text
My presence
  My life
  My words
  My actions
  Boldly proclaim,
  "There is no God!"

I sinned when I wanted
  And never repented
  No intention of
  Because I thought I was be fulfilled
  I thought porn was caring for me
  I thought lust was healing me.

But my sins
  Chew on my bones
  And gnawed on my flesh
  And I was immune to the pain
  And could not see what it was doing.

I was dead in my trespasses
  and sins
  Because I walked according
  To the ways of this world,
  According to every whim of Satan
  Disobeying you with every breath of my life
  I dwelled in my own fleshly desires
  I did what was right in my own eyes
  Disobeying you
  And sitting under your wrath.

But you,
  O God
  Forever rich in mercy
  Because of your great love for me
  Took me from death
  To life with your Son
  Even when I was dead.

I am saved by grace!

You raised me up with Christ
  So why?
  So that you can display
  Your immeasurable riches of your grace
  Through the kindness of your Son

I was saved by grace through faith
  Nothing that I am
  Nothing I have ever did
  Nothing that I can ever do
  Because you gave me everything
  Because you gave me your Son

I will boast in nothing less
  Then Jesus' blood and righteousness.

Everything that I am
  I am your work and poem.

Give me your Spirit
  Write your word upon my heart
  Dwell in my heart
  And go and send me.
