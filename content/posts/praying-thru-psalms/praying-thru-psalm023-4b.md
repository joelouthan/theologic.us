## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Lord
</div>

```text
Death, sin, hell, and Satan
  I still fear them
  I still alarmed at their presence
  I am still scared

Yet, I am reminded
  that you came into our world
  not full of power
  but filled with vulnerability
  at the risk of your life
  and the lives of your parents
  you could not protect yourself
  but your family were at the mercies
  of your Father's great sovereignty.

And yet, I am further reminded
  because you gave up your life
  because you handed your body over to be crucified
  you defeated my fears
  you have conquered my actual enemies

I fear no evil
  I fear you
  You are my King and my God
  You alone have the power
  to save me
  from despair.

Amen.
```
