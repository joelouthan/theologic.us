## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The Only One Worthy of My Trust
</div>

```text
What is my life, O Lord,
  that I have spent
  most of my years
  trusting in gods that weak and stupid
  and couldn't save themselves.

What is my mind, O Lord,
  that my very nature
  is incline not to think of you
  but of the things of the world
  as though anything in the material plane
  could actually give me an ounce of real joy.

What is my heart, O God,
  that breeds contempt
  against my Creator and my Kingdom
  that wages war
  against the Spirit of peace
  that blasphemes your holy name
  and sins against you continuously.

My Lord and my God,
  give me your precious mercy
  so that I might live and not perish
  give me your grace
  to obey your word and do your will
  give me your love
  so I will be precious in your sight.

Save me from hell and death
  and I can worship you
  for all of my days
  till the end of time.

Amen.
```
