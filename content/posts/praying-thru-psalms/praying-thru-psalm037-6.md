```text
Holy, holy, holy
  are you, my Lord.

Human history and my life
  is filled with everybody 
  being mighty when they are weak
  and conquering over the less fortunate
  and the weaker persons

Truth be told
  we are all weak and feeble.
  Our strength amounts to nothing
  Our minds know nothing
  Our hearts are cold and embittered
  Our souls have nothing
  next to you and who you are.

My Christ,
  you came down
  as a baby
  lived as a weak human
  and died terribly
  You are the meekest
  and you have inherited all of existance
  And you did so
  so that you can save a wretch like me
  from my sins and back to you.

You are my living Christ
  I praise you for your life
  Now, I am yours
  and you are mine forevermore.

I love you.

Amen.
```
