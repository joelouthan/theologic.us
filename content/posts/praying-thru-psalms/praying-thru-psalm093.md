## The Psalm

>Psalm 93 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed, enveloped in strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken. 

><sup> 2  </sup>Your throne has been established from the beginning; you are from eternity. 

><sup> 3  </sup>The floods have lifted up, LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves. 

><sup> 4  </sup>Greater than the roar of a huge torrent— the mighty breakers of the sea— the LORD on high is majestic. 

><sup> 5  </sup>LORD, your testimonies are completely reliable; holiness adorns your house for all the days to come.

```text
You are the God
  of all splendor and grace

Your beauty is
  beyond my comprehension

Your power is
  the definition of amazing

Your grace is
  always undeserving

Your mercy
  will never come to an end

Because of you
  I am alive
  I am free
  I am your child
  and I will worship you
  because you are great
  holy
  righteous
  just
  grace
  mercy
  perfect
  love
  almighty

Be exalted, my Lord
  today
```
