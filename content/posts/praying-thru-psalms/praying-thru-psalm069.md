## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Savior
</div>

```text
I sit in the darkness once again
I have been here before
this a quiet and cold place
where I can smell the sin
waiting for me to sleep.

All of the pain
all of the loss
all of the sin
that I have ever experienced
has brought me back to this place
and it is cold and dark
where I can almost make out the evil
waiting for me to lay down

My sickness
my sin
my disease
my brokenness
are now my companions

And every time
I come back here
I would be devoured
and eating to the near last bite
and you would come and get me
and keep my soul.

This time
this round
this year
I stay awake
alive
quick
strong
in this sadness
in this quiet
int his cold
because now you are my only companion
you are my beloved
you are my love
you are my God

Keep me
keep your son
don't let me perish.

But more so
just stay with me
just keep me with you
and I will always be okay
because I am yours.


Amen.
```
