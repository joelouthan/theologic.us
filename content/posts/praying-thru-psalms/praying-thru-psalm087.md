## The Psalm

>Psalm 87 (CSB)  
> A psalm of the sons of Korah. A song. 

><sup> 1 </sup> The city he founded is on the holy mountains. 

><sup> 2 </sup> The LORD loves Zion’s city gates more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Glorious things are said about you, city of God. Selah 

><sup> 4 </sup> “I will make a record of those who know me: Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush— each one was born there.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> And it will be said of Zion, “This one and that one were born in her.” The Most High himself will establish her. 

><sup> 6 </sup> When he registers the peoples, the LORD will record, “This one was born there.” Selah 

><sup> 7 </sup> Singers and dancers alike will say, “My whole source of joy is in you.”

Where is my home
  and my heart
  and my love
  and my belongings
  and my rest?

None other
  than your Blessed Son
  who is my King of kings
  but who is my friend
  and my oldest brother
  and my love and satisfaction.

You have proven yourself over
  time and time again
  that you are mine
  and I am yours
  forevermore.

And there is nothing
  that can harm me
  hurt me
  damage me
  or separate me
  from your precious love.

You are my God
  and my Christ
  my keeper
  and my Lord
  You are exalted
  far above
  all of my gods.

I will exalt you
  till my last heartbeat
  till my dying breath
  till my final thought
  I will worship you
  I will glorify you
  forever.

Amen.
```
