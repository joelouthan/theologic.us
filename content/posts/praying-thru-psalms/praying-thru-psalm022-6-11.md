## The Psalm

>Psalm 22:6–11 (CSB)  
><sup>6</sup> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by people. 

><sup>7</sup> Everyone who sees me mocks me; they sneer and shake their heads: 

><sup>8</sup> “He relies on the LORD; let him save him; let the LORD rescue him, since he takes pleasure in him.” 

><sup>9</sup> It was you who brought me out of the womb, making me secure at my mother’s breast. 

><sup>10</sup> I was given over to you at birth; you have been my God from my mother’s womb. 

><sup>11</sup> Don’t be far from me, because distress is near and there’s no one to help.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Dear God!

```text
Who am I 
  that I have been rejected a million times 
  and despised a million times more?

You say, 
  “Speak of my love” 
  and it falls on deaf ears. 
  You say, “Speak of my power” 
  and it means little to the strong. 
  You say, “Speak of my glory” 
  and their eyes remain blind.

However, you saved me. 
  You made me with your hands. 
  You are the one who started my heartbeat. 
  More than that, 
  when I was wicked and evil 
  and when I despised your holy name, 
  you did nothing 
  but see me 
  and let your grace 
  and love fall on me.

Once more, 
  you were always my God. 
  Even after my mother abandoned me 
  and while my father sought to destroy me, 
  You were my God.

Even when I didn’t know you, 
  your righteousness and holiness 
  tainted my walking corpse 
  and I tasted of your power.

But your mercies come quickly: 
  you followed that up with your heart in place of mine.

Be ever so close to me. 
  Be the whisper that draws me out--
  yes, even into the wilderness. 
  Because if I have You, 
  then I have everything I need.

Amen.
```
