## The Psalm

>Psalm 1 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> How happy is the one who does not walk in the advice of the wicked or stand in the pathway with sinners or sit in the company of mockers! 

><sup>2</sup> Instead, his delight is in the LORD’s instruction, and he meditates on it day and night. 

><sup>3</sup> He is like a tree planted beside flowing streams that bears its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. 

><sup>4</sup> The wicked are not like this; instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away. 

><sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand up in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 

><sup>6</sup> For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  O Lord,
</div>

```text
Like a child, I have fallen and all of my strength has left me.
As my precious Father, put me back up on my feet and hold my hands so I can learn to run to you.

Give me your strength and might.
Give me your word and your promises.

Oh, how you give to me. You give me your love and you see to it that I make it back  to you.

By only You will I be able to grow, mature and stand with you in your presence.
 
I distinctly remember my life before Your life.
I remember disease, destruction, slavery, and death.

My little heart and feeble mind wants to give up and turn my face back towards death.

Then I would leave Life. I would step out of the fullness of joy. I would then settle for lesser pleasures. I would not have You.

God, I am still weak like a little child. Give me your strength and love. Turn my heart towards you. Run towards me and pick me up once more.
```
