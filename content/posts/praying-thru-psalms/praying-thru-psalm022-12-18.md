## The Psalm

>Psalm 22:12–18 (CSB)  
><sup>12</sup> Many bulls surround me; strong ones of Bashan encircle me. 

><sup>13</sup> They open their mouths against me— lions, mauling and roaring. 

><sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed; my heart is like wax, melting within me. 

><sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like baked clay; my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You put me into the dust of death. 

><sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has closed in on me; they pierced my hands and my feet. 

><sup>17</sup> I can count all my bones; people look and stare at me. 

><sup>18</sup> They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  Dear God,
</div>

```text
My enemies are on all sides 
  and their attacks are relentless, 
  you are my protector.

When lions clamp down on my guts, 
  you are the teeth-breaker and my healer.

When I am buried, 
  you call me out of the ground.

When I was dead in my sins, 
  you lived, died, and rose alive
  so that I might live.

You have never left me.

You have always been with me 
  even when I did not know nor loved you.

You have always been there.

And I will forever worship you, my God.
```
