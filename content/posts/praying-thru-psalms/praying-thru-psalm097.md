## The Psalm

>Psalm 97 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The LORD reigns! Let the earth rejoice; let the many coasts and islands be glad. 

><sup> 2  </sup>Clouds and total darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 

><sup> 3  </sup>Fire goes before him and burns up his foes on every side. 

><sup> 4  </sup>His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles. 

><sup> 5  </sup>The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD— at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

><sup> 6  </sup>The heavens proclaim his righteousness; all the peoples see his glory. 

><sup> 7  </sup>All who serve carved images, those who boast in worthless idols, will be put to shame. All the gods must worship him. 

><sup> 8  </sup>Zion hears and is glad, Judah’s villages rejoice because of your judgments, LORD. 

><sup> 9  </sup>For you, LORD, are the Most High over the whole earth; you are exalted above all the gods. 

><sup> 10  </sup>You who love the LORD, hate evil! He protects the lives of his faithful ones; he rescues them from the power of the wicked. 

><sup> 11  </sup>Light dawns for the righteous, gladness for the upright in heart. 

><sup> 12  </sup>Be glad in the LORD, you righteous ones, and give thanks to his holy name.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Righteousness
</div>

```text
For you, O Lord
  are high
  above all the earth

And you alone
  are exalted
  far above
  all of my gods

I thought
  that what I did was good enough
  to have nothing to do with you
  and wanted everything you provide
  to worship your gifts
  instead of worshipping the Giver

But you were none content
  with my life unto death
  you will not let your son perish
  nor see corruption

You gave me a new heart
  renewed mind
  gift of repentance 
  and Your Spirit
  because you were thoughtful
  mindful
  gracious
  to give me your Son

Now I get to sing
  now I get to worship
  now I get to proclaim
  you are my Lord
  and you are my great God!
