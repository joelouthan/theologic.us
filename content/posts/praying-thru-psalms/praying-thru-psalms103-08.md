## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
I bear witness
  with my entire life
  with my heart
  that you are this kind
  and this merciful
  and this gracious
  and this loving 
  to a wretch like me

Look at my sins!
  they are too numerous to count
  they are too vile to mention
  they are too great to be forgiven
  they are cause for your great wrath

I was the chief of sinners
  and done more evil in your sight
  than anybody could imagine

But you came to me
  you shown mercy to me
  and you lifted me up
  out of death
  and into life
  and into your presence
  and into your family
  and into your kingdom
  and into your glory
  forever.

You have always been kind
  and compassionate
  and merciful
  and good to me.

I praise you
  you are my God.
```
