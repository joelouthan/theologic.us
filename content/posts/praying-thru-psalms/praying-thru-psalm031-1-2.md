## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Only Savior</div>

```text
Who is like you, God?
  and who compares to you?

You alone are worthy
  of honor
  of praise
  of worship for all of my days.
The world critiques
  ridicules
  slams
  kills
  destroys.
But you are the only Savior,
  who pulls me from hell
  brings me to your bosom
  and gives me peaceful rest
  because you alone are grace.
Because you have declared me to be your child,
  do not ignore me.
  Hear my cries!
  Make me like you!
  Make me righteous like you!
  So I will never depart from you
  or you would ever depart from me.
Keep me from this world,
  from the snares of the Devil
  from the traps of Demons
  from the bowels of Sheol
  from the darkness of my heart.
Bring me to your throne,
 and judge me rightly,
 in the blood-stained robe of your only begotten Son.

Amen.


```
