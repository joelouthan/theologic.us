><sup></sup> A psalm of thanksgiving. 

><sup>1</sup> Let the whole earth shout triumphantly to the LORD! 

><sup>2</sup> Serve the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. 

><sup>3</sup> Acknowledge that the LORD is God. He made us, and we are hisâ€” his people, the sheep of his pasture.

I will sing!
  And I will shout!
  I will praise the Lord of Hosts!
  For he alone is worthy to be praised!

He is my heart and my life
  I will gladly lay down my life
  because he has saved me from the depths of hell
  because he has loved me from the beginning of time
  because he has kept me close to his precious heart
  because I am his son and he is my Father

So whatever I can do
  however I can proclaim
  however I can sing
  however I can dance
  however I will write
  however I will think
  however I will worship
  my great God who is the source of all good
  he alone has been good to me
  for the world and sin and Satan and his demons
  have sought to destroy me and crushed me and keep me from my God

But my God is stronger
  of infinite might
  he has nor will ever lose me
  he has sent his only begotten Son
  to destroy and vanquished the forces of evil

Now my enemies are down
  they have no power over me
  for the Triune God lives in me
  forever
  I am his and he is mine

He has loved me with an everlasting love
  let me sing unto my God
  let me gaze upon his beauty
  let me write a trillion words
  and I will fall short
  because there is no end to his loveliness

Amen
```
