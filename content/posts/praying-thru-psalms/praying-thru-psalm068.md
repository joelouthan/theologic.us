Worthy is Your Power
</div>

```text
I have seen
  texts
  empty promises
  words
  feelings
  good intentions
  exchanges
  hopes
  doubts
  knowledge
  wisdom
  charity
  love
  that could try to fix me.

I was beyond repair
  nothing on this earth
  would make me whole
  would seal my heart
  would fulfill eternity inside
  right my mind
  open my eyes
  unmute my tongue
  unplug my ears
  clear my mind
  give a beat to my heart
  give me life.

Nothing. Because I have tried it all
  and I found the world wanting.

You gave me your Spirit
  and now I am fully alive in you.

Preserve me, O God
  lay your power upon me
  to take me to the end
  when I get to hold your Son's face
  in my little hands
  forever and ever.

I love you.

Amen.
```
