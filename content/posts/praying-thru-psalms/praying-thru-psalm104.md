## The Psalm

>Psalm 104 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> My soul, bless the LORD! LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with majesty and splendor. 

><sup>2</sup> He wraps himself in light as if it were a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy, 

><sup>3</sup> laying the beams of his palace on the waters above, making the clouds his chariot, walking on the wings of the wind, 

><sup>4</sup> and making the winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants. 

><sup>5</sup> He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken. 

><sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as if it were a garment; the water stood above the mountains. 

><sup>7</sup> At your rebuke the water fled; at the sound of your thunder they hurried away— 

><sup>8</sup> mountains rose and valleys sank— to the place you established for them. 

><sup>9</sup> You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never cover the earth again. 

><sup>10</sup> He causes the springs to gush into the valleys; they flow between the mountains. 

><sup>11</sup> They supply water for every wild beast; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. 

><sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky live beside the springs; they make their voices heard among the foliage. 

><sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his palace; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of your labor. 

><sup>14</sup> He causes grass to grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth, 

><sup>15</sup> wine that makes human hearts glad— making his face shine with oil— and bread that sustains human hearts. 

><sup>16</sup> The trees of the LORD flourish, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. 

><sup>17</sup> There the birds make their nests; storks make their homes in the pine trees. 

><sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes. 

><sup>19</sup> He made the moon to mark the festivals; the sun knows when to set. 

><sup>20</sup> You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals stir. 

><sup>21</sup> The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. 

><sup>22</sup> The sun rises; they go back and lie down in their dens. 

><sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work and to his labor until evening. 

><sup>24</sup> How countless are your works, LORD! In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures. 

><sup>25</sup> Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number— living things both large and small. 

><sup>26</sup> There the ships move about, and Leviathan, which you formed to play there. 

><sup>27</sup> All of them wait for you to give them their food at the right time. 

><sup>28</sup> When you give it to them, they gather it; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things. 

><sup>29</sup> When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust. 

><sup>30</sup> When you send your breath, they are created, and you renew the surface of the ground. 

><sup>31</sup> May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works. 

><sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles; he touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke. 

><sup>33</sup> I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live. 

><sup>34</sup> May my meditation be pleasing to him; I will rejoice in the LORD. 

><sup>35</sup> May sinners vanish from the earth and wicked people be no more. My soul, bless the LORD! Hallelujah!
