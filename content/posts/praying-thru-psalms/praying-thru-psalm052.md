## The Psalm

>Psalm 52 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A Maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite went and reported to Saul, telling him, “David went to Ahimelech’s house.” 

><sup>1</sup> Why boast about evil, you hero! God’s faithful love is constant. 

><sup>2</sup> Like a sharpened razor, your tongue devises destruction, working treachery. 

><sup>3</sup> You love evil instead of good, lying instead of speaking truthfully. Selah 

><sup>4</sup> You love any words that destroy, you treacherous tongue! 

><sup>5</sup> This is why God will bring you down forever. He will take you, ripping you out of your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 

><sup>6</sup> The righteous will see and fear, and they will derisively say about that hero, 

><sup>7</sup> “Here is the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, taking refuge in his destructive behavior.” 

><sup>8</sup> But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever. 

><sup>9</sup> I will praise you forever for what you have done. In the presence of your faithful people, I will put my hope in your name, for it is good.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Faithful Love
</div>

```text
Everything that I have
  And all that I got
  It is in you.

I have nowhere else to go
  And no one else to turn to
  You are my righteousness
  In you, I will trust.

I will bless your name forever 
  I will worship your name on high
  I will proclaim your word to everyone
  I will preach your gospel to the end
  I will love you forever
  I will fear you for my life
  I will be still
  And know you are my God.

Amen.
```
