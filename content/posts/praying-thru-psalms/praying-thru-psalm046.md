## The Psalm

>Psalm 46 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A song of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. 

><sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble. 

><sup>2</sup> Therefore we will not be afraid, though the earth trembles and the mountains topple into the depths of the seas, 

><sup>3</sup> though its water roars and foams and the mountains quake with its turmoil. Selah 

><sup>4</sup> There is a river— its streams delight the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High. 

><sup>5</sup> God is within her; she will not be toppled. God will help her when the morning dawns. 

><sup>6</sup> Nations rage, kingdoms topple; the earth melts when he lifts his voice. 

><sup>7</sup> The LORD of Armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah 

><sup>8</sup> Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation on the earth. 

><sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease throughout the earth. He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces; he sets wagons ablaze. 

><sup>10</sup> “Stop fighting, and know that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth.” 

><sup>11</sup> The LORD of Armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Refuge
</div>

```text
You alone
  are my righteousness
  and my exalted Lord
  who rules and reigns in the heavens.

Majesty
  and my Love
  who can do what you have done?

My circumstances
  and my time here on earth
  do not define me
  nor do my sins
  nor do my actions
  nor do my desires
  nor does my heart.

Only you
  King Jesus
  give me all of my identity
  and worth
  and value.

Nothing else
  just you.
  My Lord and my Rock.

Amen.
```
