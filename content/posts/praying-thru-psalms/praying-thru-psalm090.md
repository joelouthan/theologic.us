## The Psalms

>Psalm 90 (CSB)  
> A prayer of Moses, the man of God. 

><sup> 1  </sup>Lord, you have been our refuge in every generation. 

><sup> 2  </sup>Before the mountains were born, before you gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, you are God. 

><sup> 3  </sup>You return mankind to the dust, saying, “Return, descendants of Adam.” 

><sup> 4  </sup>For in your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that passes by, like a few hours of the night. 

><sup> 5  </sup>You end their lives; they sleep. They are like grass that grows in the morning— 

><sup> 6  </sup>in the morning it sprouts and grows; by evening it withers and dries up. 

><sup> 7  </sup>For we are consumed by your anger; we are terrified by your wrath. 

><sup> 8  </sup>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 

><sup> 9  </sup>For all our days ebb away under your wrath; we end our years like a sigh. 

><sup> 10  </sup>Our lives last seventy years or, if we are strong, eighty years. Even the best of them are struggle and sorrow; indeed, they pass quickly and we fly away. 

><sup> 11  </sup>Who understands the power of your anger? Your wrath matches the fear that is due you. 

><sup> 12  </sup>Teach us to number our days carefully so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts. 

><sup> 13  </sup>LORD—how long? Turn and have compassion on your servants. 

><sup> 14  </sup>Satisfy us in the morning with your faithful love so that we may shout with joy and be glad all our days. 

><sup> 15  </sup>Make us rejoice for as many days as you have humbled us, for as many years as we have seen adversity. 

><sup> 16  </sup>Let your work be seen by your servants, and your splendor by their children. 

><sup> 17  </sup>Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish for us the work of our hands— establish the work of our hands!

What is my life, Lord
  that you were so sweet to me
  that you were so tender
  that you thought of me
  and preserved me?

How many times
  should have perished in my own sin
  should have been destroyed by sin
  should have been wiped because of others' sin?

I cannot count that high
  my mind cannot comprehend
  my life is always at risk
  I shall lose to my life
  at a mere whim

Once more
  the times I should have died
  and I shall descend into your just wrath
  and into the torments of hell
  and I shall have been held captive
  for my sins 
  and my disease
  and my wickedness
  and my treason
  and my evils.

Why did you spare me?
  Why are you so caring?
  Why do you love me so?

You took pity upon me
  and you knew I was made from dust
  and you spared me
  Moreso, you lifted me up
  and gave me a seat at your table
  and made me your son like your Son
  and you gave me everything.

I cannot begin to answer any of these questions
  but I will worship you for all of my days
  because you are my Lord and my God forever.

Amen
```
