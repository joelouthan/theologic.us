## The Psalm

>Psalm 54 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. When the Ziphites went and said to Saul, “Is David not hiding among us?” 

><sup>1</sup> God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might! 

><sup>2</sup> God, hear my prayer; listen to the words from my mouth. 

><sup>3</sup> For strangers rise up against me, and violent men intend to kill me. They do not let God guide them. Selah 

><sup>4</sup> God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my life. 

><sup>5</sup> He will repay my adversaries for their evil. Because of your faithfulness, annihilate them. 

><sup>6</sup> I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you. I will praise your name, LORD, because it is good. 

><sup>7</sup> For he has rescued me from every trouble, and my eye has looked down on my enemies.

You Are My Deliverer

I have seen so many evils in my life
  And I thought I had so many enemies
  Because they have wounded me
  And attempted to destroy me.

I have come close to the edge of death
  Because I was desperate for your love
  And I cannot bear to live one more moment
  Under persecution and torment.

I was already weak.
  The schemes of the devil?
  They worked.
  I was defeated.
  And I was no more.

But in whatever way
  I cannot understand
  You saved me
  And you saved me time and time again
  No matter how far I stray
  No matter if I was faithful
  You came and grabbed me and brough me close.

What about that time
  When you gave me your peace?
  How did I react?
  I fled full long into sin
  I gave over to lust and temptation
  I was seeking nothing from you
  Because I thought I had lost everything
  I was too blinded
  To see 
  That no matter what I have lost
  Even my life
  I have everything
  Because I have you
  You are the holy one of God
  Christ Jesus my Lord
  I don't need to turn anywhere else
  I don't need to go anywhere else
  I have you.

You are my All-in-all.

Be my loving God.

Have mercy on me.

Thank you for saving me
  And making me your son.

Amen.
```
