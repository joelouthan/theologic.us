## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Judge and Mercy Alone</div>

```text
Every sin against me
   does not counter
   any of my sins.
 
Their sins are their sins.
   My sins are my sins.
   And you will judge accordingly.

But I know of your perfection,
   your beauty
   your majesty
   your holiness
   and your righteousness.
 
If you looked upon me,
   you will see my treason
   my affairs
   my thoughts
   my heart's desires
   my lusts
   my wickedness!
 
And by that,
   you will be left wanting.
 
But it is my sins,
   my treason
   my trespass
   my rage
   my war
   against you
   that you looked upon
   and saw my infinite shortcomings
   and decided
   alone upon your grace
   alone upon your mercy
   alone upon your sweet love
   and you saved me.
 
How?

I was meant to die
I was meant to take on the cosmos-filled wrath
I was meant for hell

But you sent your Son
   to die for me
   to absorb every ounce of wrath
   to and descend into hell
   so that I might live
   and move
   and my being 
   with you
   unto you
   by you
   through you
   and from you
   alone.
 
You are my God forever.

Forever I will love you.
