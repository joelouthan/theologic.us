```text
You are the only being
  when you speak
  things actually happen
  When you promise
  they are unbreakable
  When you declare
  it is so
  When you proclaim
  it comes to pass.

All of your promises are yes and amen.

So when I hear your voice,
  when you beckon me from the depths of hades
  when you spoke a new identity in me
  when you called my name
  I answered.

I was yours from the moment on.

I have tried to flee
  into my own sins
  and back into hell.
  But you are forever my rescuer
  my portion
  and deliverer.

You have spoken my name
  That means I am yours.
  And that is unbreakable
  and perfect.

Be glorified today.

```
