## The Psalms

>Psalm 92 (CSB)  
> A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. 

><sup> 1  </sup>It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praise to your name, Most High, 

><sup> 2  </sup>to declare your faithful love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, 

><sup> 3  </sup>with a ten-stringed harp and the music of a lyre. 

><sup> 4  </sup>For you have made me rejoice, LORD, by what you have done; I will shout for joy because of the works of your hands. 

><sup> 5  </sup>How magnificent are your works, LORD, how profound your thoughts! 

><sup> 6  </sup>A stupid person does not know, a fool does not understand this: 

><sup> 7  </sup>though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be eternally destroyed. 

><sup> 8  </sup>But you, LORD, are exalted forever. 

><sup> 9  </sup>For indeed, LORD, your enemies— indeed, your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. 

><sup> 10  </sup>You have lifted up my horn like that of a wild ox; I have been anointed with the finest oil. 

><sup> 11  </sup>My eyes look at my enemies; when evildoers rise against me, my ears hear them. 

><sup> 12  </sup>The righteous thrive like a palm tree and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon. 

><sup> 13  </sup>Planted in the house of the LORD, they thrive in the courts of our God. 

><sup> 14  </sup>They will still bear fruit in old age, healthy and green, 

><sup> 15  </sup>to declare, “The LORD is just; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.”

I worship you
  Almighty God
  there is none like you.

Who is like you, O Lord
  who has spare my life
  who has saved my soul
  who has made your home in me
  who is the lover of my heart?

There is none
  because you have never left nor betrayed
  despite my wickedness and folly
  you have been for me
  and you have been there
  always to bring me back to you!

With my mouth
  I certainly will sing
  I will give testimony
  I will build my life giving you thanks
  I will preach your word
  I will proclaim your name
  You are the only One
  that my heart desires.

I love you
  and all that is within me
  I will bless your holy name.

Amen
```
