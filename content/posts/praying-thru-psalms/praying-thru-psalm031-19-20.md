```text
My Lord,
  my life bears witness
  that you alone protect me
  shield me
  provide for me
  and place your loving arms
  wrapped around me.

You hold me like a child,
  for I am just as vulnerable
  and would be devoured by dogs
  if it was not for you.
I praise your holy name
  for you are Lord Most High.
  So be exalted
  in my life
  and with my words.
Thank you for sparing me
 and thank you for saving my life
 Thank you for shielding me
 from the world
 from sin
 from Satan and his demons
 and sparing me from hell
 and protecting me
 from your just wrath.

Have mercy on me,
  for all of my days
  and bring me home quickly
  so I can stare into your eyes
  for all of eternity.
Amen.

```
