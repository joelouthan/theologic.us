## The Psalm

>Psalm 103:12 (CSB) As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

My mind and heart and soul are continually filled and constantly abounding in sin--every source of my being is filled with wickedness towards you.

I see that Christ, in his divinity and humanity, is perfect towards you.

But I know you dwell in me and yet, my flesh still wages war against you.

But look at what you have told me:

>I have *infinitely* removed your transgressions from you.

All of this crap in me? You have removed every bit of my crap *eternally* from me.

I know this because your Son died and bleed for me.

I will always praise your glorious name!

Amen!
