## The Psalm

>Psalm 44 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. 

><sup>1</sup> God, we have heard with our ears— our ancestors have told us— the work you accomplished in their days, in days long ago: 

><sup>2</sup> In order to plant them, you displaced the nations by your hand; in order to settle them, you brought disaster on the peoples. 

><sup>3</sup> For they did not take the land by their sword— their arm did not bring them victory— but by your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable toward them. 

><sup>4</sup> You are my King, my God, who ordains victories for Jacob. 

><sup>5</sup> Through you we drive back our foes; through your name we trample our enemies. 

><sup>6</sup> For I do not trust in my bow, and my sword does not bring me victory. 

><sup>7</sup> But you give us victory over our foes and let those who hate us be disgraced. 

><sup>8</sup> We boast in God all day long; we will praise your name forever. Selah 

><sup>9</sup> But you have rejected and humiliated us; you do not march out with our armies. 

><sup>10</sup> You make us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have taken plunder for themselves. 

><sup>11</sup> You hand us over to be eaten like sheep and scatter us among the nations. 

><sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing; you make no profit from selling them. 

><sup>13</sup> You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us. 

><sup>14</sup> You make us a joke among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. 

><sup>15</sup> My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face, 

><sup>16</sup> because of the taunts of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy and avenger. 

><sup>17</sup> All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten you or betrayed your covenant. 

><sup>18</sup> Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from your path. 

><sup>19</sup> But you have crushed us in a haunt of jackals and have covered us with deepest darkness. 

><sup>20</sup> If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god, 

><sup>21</sup> wouldn’t God have found this out, since he knows the secrets of the heart? 

><sup>22</sup> Because of you we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered. 

><sup>23</sup> Wake up, Lord! Why are you sleeping? Get up! Don’t reject us forever! 

><sup>24</sup> Why do you hide and forget our affliction and oppression? 

><sup>25</sup> For we have sunk down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground. 

><sup>26</sup> Rise up! Help us! Redeem us because of your faithful love.

Before Christ
  I was without strength
  I would succumb to the enemy
  day and night.

Before Christ
  I was without glory
  I would lose all of my battles
  and torn to pieces.

Before Christ
  I was filled with sin
  my consequences
  and my enemies
  would have surely put me to death.

But Christ
  stepped in
  rescued me
  clothed me
  gave me food
  gave me strength
  gave me protection
  and gave me the one thing I never have
  everlasting love.

Dear God,
  Let me have your Son
  as my friend
  my beloved
  my Savior
  my love
  my brother
  and my King
  Forever.

Amen.
```
