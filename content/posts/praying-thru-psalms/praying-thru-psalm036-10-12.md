## The Psalm

>Psalm 36 (CSB)  
><sup>10</sup> Spread your faithful love over those who know you, and your righteousness over the upright in heart. 

><sup>11</sup> Do not let the foot of the arrogant come near me or the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

><sup>12</sup> There! The evildoers have fallen. They have been thrown down and cannot rise.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Unforgettable Love
</div>

```text
Keep your love upon me
  do not let me go
  do not turn your back on me
  do not forget me
  do not forsake me

If I am arrogant
  then discipline me

If I am wicked
  then wash me clean

If I am evil
  then make me holy.

Whatever you can do
  to keep me close
  then do it.

Because I want you
  and nobody else
  and not even sin
  nor things of this world
  would be worth
  be one second apart
  from your love.

Keep me Lord

Defeat my real enemies

Love those who oppose you
  and save them to you.

You are the only God
  who is mighty to save.

Amen.
```
