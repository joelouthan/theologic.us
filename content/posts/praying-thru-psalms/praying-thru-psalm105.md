## The Psalm

>Psalm 105 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; proclaim his deeds among the peoples. 

><sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell about all his wondrous works! 

><sup>3</sup> Boast in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. 

><sup>4</sup> Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his face always. 

><sup>5</sup> Remember the wondrous works he has done, his wonders, and the judgments he has pronounced, 

><sup>6</sup> you offspring of Abraham his servant, Jacob’s descendants—his chosen ones. 

><sup>7</sup> He is the LORD our God; his judgments govern the whole earth. 

><sup>8</sup> He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he ordained for a thousand generations— 

><sup>9</sup> the covenant he made with Abraham, swore to Isaac, 

><sup>10</sup> and confirmed to Jacob as a decree and to Israel as a permanent covenant: 

><sup>11</sup> “I will give the land of Canaan to you as your inherited portion.” 

><sup>12</sup> When they were few in number, very few indeed, and resident aliens in Canaan, 

><sup>13</sup> wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another, 

><sup>14</sup> he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their behalf: 

><sup>15</sup> “Do not touch my anointed ones, or harm my prophets.” 

><sup>16</sup> He called down famine against the land and destroyed the entire food supply. 

><sup>17</sup> He had sent a man ahead of them— Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 

><sup>18</sup> They hurt his feet with shackles; his neck was put in an iron collar. 

><sup>19</sup> Until the time his prediction came true, the word of the LORD tested him. 

><sup>20</sup> The king sent for him and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free. 

><sup>21</sup> He made him master of his household, ruler over all his possessions— 

><sup>22</sup> binding his officials at will and instructing his elders. 

><sup>23</sup> Then Israel went to Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham. 

><sup>24</sup> The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them more numerous than their foes, 

><sup>25</sup> whose hearts he turned to hate his people and to deal deceptively with his servants. 

><sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 

><sup>27</sup> They performed his miraculous signs among them and wonders in the land of Ham. 

><sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and it became dark— for did they not defy his commands? 

><sup>29</sup> He turned their water into blood and caused their fish to die. 

><sup>30</sup> Their land was overrun with frogs, even in their royal chambers. 

><sup>31</sup> He spoke, and insects came— gnats throughout their country. 

><sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, and lightning throughout their land. 

><sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their territory. 

><sup>34</sup> He spoke, and locusts came— young locusts without number. 

><sup>35</sup> They devoured all the vegetation in their land and consumed the produce of their land. 

><sup>36</sup> He struck all the firstborn in their land, all their first progeny. 

><sup>37</sup> Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold, and no one among his tribes stumbled. 

><sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they left, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them. 

><sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud as a covering and gave a fire to light up the night. 

><sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quail and satisfied them with bread from heaven. 

><sup>41</sup> He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a stream in the desert. 

><sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy promise to Abraham his servant. 

><sup>43</sup> He brought his people out with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy. 

><sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited what other peoples had worked for. 

><sup>45</sup> All this happened so that they might keep his statutes and obey his instructions. Hallelujah!
