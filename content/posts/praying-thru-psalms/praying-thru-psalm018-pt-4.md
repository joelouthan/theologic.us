## The Psalm

>Psalm 18:31–45 (CSB)  
><sup>31</sup> For who is God besides the LORD? And who is a rock? Only our God. 

><sup>32</sup> God—he clothes me with strength and makes my way perfect. 

><sup>33</sup> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and sets me securely on the heights. 

><sup>34</sup> He trains my hands for war; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 

><sup>35</sup> You have given me the shield of your salvation; your right hand upholds me, and your humility exalts me. 

><sup>36</sup> You make a spacious place beneath me for my steps, and my ankles do not give way. 

><sup>37</sup> I pursue my enemies and overtake them; I do not turn back until they are wiped out. 

><sup>38</sup> I crush them, and they cannot get up; they fall beneath my feet. 

><sup>39</sup> You have clothed me with strength for battle; you subdue my adversaries beneath me. 

><sup>40</sup> You have made my enemies retreat before me; I annihilate those who hate me. 

><sup>41</sup> They cry for help, but there is no one to save them— they cry to the LORD, but he does not answer them. 

><sup>42</sup> I pulverize them like dust before the wind; I trample them like mud in the streets. 

><sup>43</sup> You have freed me from the feuds among the people; you have appointed me the head of nations; a people I had not known serve me. 

><sup>44</sup> Foreigners submit to me cringing; as soon as they hear they obey me. 

><sup>45</sup> Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their fortifications.

## The Prayer

```text
Who is like you, my Lord?

Who is like my God?

The one who has saved me and never abandoned me. The one who is my shield when fiery arrows have scorched the skies. The one who has called me righteous and equips me according to his own righteousness?

The one who has given me the speed to run to him in times of trouble? The one who has set me upon the mountaintop to see his awesome glory?

I have been trained but not by my own doing but by the teacher who will see my training till the end. I stand tall but not by my own strength but by the strength of your mighty hand. I have been made great but not my own pithy efforts but made great by your sweet gentle love, grace, and mercy.

My enemies, they have nothing on me. Their greatest numbers amass in vain. Their weapons cannot take my life. They battle without purpose because my King has soundly, completely, definitely, perfectly conquered them when He went to the cross and gave his life up so that I might live.

My foot presses against Death’s neck as I can hear his skull grind into the dirt beneath him. He waves at me but he has no power because he rules nothing.

You have given me this power. You alone have given me life.

I love you, Lord.

Amen
