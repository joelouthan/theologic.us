## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
All of my desires and affections
</div>

```text
What did your Son say?
  Eat of my flesh
  Drink of my blood
  For God alone is good.

There is no other manna but your Son.

There is no Bread of life other than your Son.

There is no other Living Water other than your Son.

There is no life outside of your Son.

I will taste and see
  because my Lord alone is good
  For in him I live and move and have my being

I will forever make a joyful noise

I am so weak
  so be my strength
  I am so filled with sin
  so grant me your Sonâ€™s righteousness
  I am so far
  so send your Spirit to bring me home
  I am an orphan
  My God, adopt me as your own.

Be glorified. Today.
```
