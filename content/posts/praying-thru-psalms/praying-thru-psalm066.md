## The Psalm

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Worthy Are You to Be Praised
</div>

```text
Who alone
  who saves the helpless and the weak
  the far and the lost
  the powerless and the downtrodden
  the slave and the oppressed
  the wicked and the sinful
  the blind and the deaf
  the mute and the dumb

But who Lord
  when I was oppose to your will
  when my every breath commit treason against your holiness
  when my every thought was dipped in wickedness and sin
  when my every heartbeat longed to be my own god

But who Lord
  saw me in my wickedness
  in my deceit
  in my folly
  in my stupidness
  in my ignorance
  in my sin
  and had the deepest affection for me.

Nothing stopped you
  you set your love on me
  you sent your Son after me
  you gave your Spirit to seal me
  your grace keeps me
  your mercy secures me
  your righteousness is mine.

There is none like you
  because you are the only God
  who saves.

Amen.
```
