## The Psalm

>Psalm 23:6a (CSB) Only goodness

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Great God,
</div>

```text
I am reminded what Christ declared:
You alone are good.

You are the source of all good
but my heart flees and wanders from you

But in your Word,
  you declared me holy
  because you are holy.
  you declared me righteous
  because Christ is righteous
  you declared me justified
  because you alone justified.

Then because of who You are,
  I am awashed in your grace upon grace
  wake up to new mercies every morning
  abounded in your steadfast love.

I praise you for your goodness.

I praise you
  because you define what good is
  and we do not.

Amen

```
