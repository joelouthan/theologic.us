## The Psalm

>Psalm 106 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his faithful love endures forever. 

><sup>2</sup> Who can declare the LORD’s mighty acts or proclaim all the praise due him? 

><sup>3</sup> How happy are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times. 

><sup>4</sup> Remember me, LORD, when you show favor to your people. Come to me with your salvation 

><sup>5</sup> so that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of your nation, and boast about your heritage. 

><sup>6</sup> Both we and our ancestors have sinned; we have done wrong and have acted wickedly. 

><sup>7</sup> Our ancestors in Egypt did not grasp the significance of your wondrous works or remember your many acts of faithful love; instead, they rebelled by the sea—the Red Sea. 

><sup>8</sup> Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his power known. 

><sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert. 

><sup>10</sup> He saved them from the power of the adversary; he redeemed them from the power of the enemy. 

><sup>11</sup> Water covered their foes; not one of them remained. 

><sup>12</sup> Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. 

><sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works and would not wait for his counsel. 

><sup>14</sup> They were seized with craving in the wilderness and tested God in the desert. 

><sup>15</sup> He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them. 

><sup>16</sup> In the camp they were envious of Moses and of Aaron, the LORD’s holy one. 

><sup>17</sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram. 

><sup>18</sup> Fire blazed throughout their assembly; flames consumed the wicked. 

><sup>19</sup> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped the cast metal image. 

><sup>20</sup> They exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating ox. 

><sup>21</sup> They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt, 

><sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham, awe-inspiring acts at the Red Sea. 

><sup>23</sup> So he said he would have destroyed them— if Moses his chosen one had not stood before him in the breach to turn his wrath away from destroying them. 

><sup>24</sup> They despised the pleasant land and did not believe his promise. 

><sup>25</sup> They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the LORD. 

><sup>26</sup> So he raised his hand against them with an oath that he would make them fall in the desert 

><sup>27</sup> and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them throughout the lands. 

><sup>28</sup> They aligned themselves with Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods. 

><sup>29</sup> They angered the LORD with their deeds, and a plague broke out against them. 

><sup>30</sup> But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stopped. 

><sup>31</sup> It was credited to him as righteousness throughout all generations to come. 

><sup>32</sup> They angered the LORD at the Waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them, 

><sup>33</sup> for they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips. 

><sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them 

><sup>35</sup> but mingled with the nations and adopted their ways. 

><sup>36</sup> They served their idols, which became a snare to them. 

><sup>37</sup> They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons. 

><sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood— the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; so the land became polluted with blood. 

><sup>39</sup> They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds. 

><sup>40</sup> Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his own inheritance. 

><sup>41</sup> He handed them over to the nations; those who hated them ruled over them. 

><sup>42</sup> Their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their power. 

><sup>43</sup> He rescued them many times, but they continued to rebel deliberately and were beaten down by their iniquity. 

><sup>44</sup> When he heard their cry, he took note of their distress, 

><sup>45</sup> remembered his covenant with them, and relented according to the abundance of his faithful love. 

><sup>46</sup> He caused them to be pitied before all their captors. 

><sup>47</sup> Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, so that we may give thanks to your holy name and rejoice in your praise. 

><sup>48</sup> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
