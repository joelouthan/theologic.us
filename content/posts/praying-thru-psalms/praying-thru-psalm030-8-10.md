## The Psalms

>Psalm 30:8–10 (CSB) LORD, I called to you; I sought favor from my Lord: “What gain is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your truth? LORD, listen and be gracious to me; LORD, be my helper.”

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My God</div>

```text
My days here are just for a moment,
  and you have number them all.
  My life remains in your hands,
  only you know my beginning and end.
Too many times,
  I have cried out
  to end my life here
  so you can bring me home.
  So much misery
  and calamity
  and confusion
  when all I wanted
  was peace beyond all understanding.
But you are the Lord my God,
  who is from everlasting to everlasting,
  who calls anything into existence,
  who predestines us to life,
  who creates the vessels made for destruction.
And yet, you sent your Son,
  who became flesh,
  who dwelt among us.
  And now we have seen God,
  the only God,
  who was at the Father's side,
  because you have made Him know.
And now from his fullness,
  I dwell in grace upon grace.
  Lord, you dictate my life.
  You tell me
  if I will see your glory.
  Be exalted in my life,
  today.
Amen.
