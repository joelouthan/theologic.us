## The Psalm

>Psalm 31:11–13 (CSB)  
><sup>11</sup> I am ridiculed by all my adversaries and even by my neighbors. I am dreaded by my acquaintances; those who see me in the street run from me. 

><sup>12</sup> I am forgotten: gone from memory like a dead person—like broken pottery. 

><sup>13</sup> I have heard the gossip of many; terror is on every side. When they conspired against me, they plotted to take my life.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Savior of My Life</div>

```text
How many times,
  my Lord,
  was I left for dead?
The amount of people who wished me dead
  were too many to count.
I have been abused,
  and used for others' perverse sins.
  I have been forgotten,
  and not attended to my needs.
  I have been exposed,
  and called a liar.
But you, O my God,
  are the only one who has saved me.
  Many people want to save me
  but lack the will and the power.
  Their heart has been turned
  but they could not help me.
My heart has been broken,
  my mind has gone.
  And I have no power within me.
But you've healed my broken,
  renewed my mind,
  and gave me your Almighty Spirit.
Since you have rescued me,
  restored me,
  redeemed me,
  and kept me,
  I am yours.
I am yours,
  and you are mine forever.

Keep me,
  the Savior of my Life
  and keep me close to your heart.
  Do not let me stray
  for I will be forgotten again
  and I will perish in hell
  apart from you.
  And that is a thought I cannot stand to bear.
Be my portion and love,
  forever.
Amen.
```
