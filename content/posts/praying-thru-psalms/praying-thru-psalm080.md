## The Psalm

>Psalm 80 (CSB)  
> For the choir director: according to “The Lilies.” A testimony of Asaph. A psalm. 

><sup> 1 </sup> Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine 

><sup> 2 </sup> on Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally your power and come to save us. 

><sup> 3 </sup> Restore us, God; make your face shine on us, so that we may be saved. 

><sup> 4 </sup> LORD God of Armies, how long will you be angry with your people’s prayers? 

><sup> 5 </sup> You fed them the bread of tears and gave them a full measure of tears to drink. 

><sup> 6 </sup> You put us at odds with our neighbors; our enemies mock us. 

><sup> 7 </sup> Restore us, God of Armies; make your face shine on us, so that we may be saved. 

><sup> 8 </sup> You dug up a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. 

><sup> 9 </sup> You cleared a place for it; it took root and filled the land. 

><sup> 10 </sup> The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches. 

><sup> 11 </sup> It sent out sprouts toward the Sea and shoots toward the River. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its fruit? 

><sup> 13 </sup> Boars from the forest tear at it and creatures of the field feed on it. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Return, God of Armies. Look down from heaven and see; take care of this vine, 

><sup> 15 </sup> the root your right hand planted, the son that you made strong for yourself. 

><sup> 16 </sup> It was cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of your countenance. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Let your hand be with the man at your right hand, with the son of man you have made strong for yourself. 

><sup> 18 </sup> Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name. 

><sup> 19 </sup> Restore us, LORD, God of Armies; make your face shine on us, so that we may be saved.

Save me, O God!

If you do not save me, I will perish  
  For I will die in my iniquity  
  I will be crushed for my wickedness.

You know I come from dust

You know I am weak and frail

You know I cannot turn to you apart from you

You are the only God and there is none beside you  
  and you are the God of grace
  you are the God of mercy
  you are the God of steadfast love

Apart from You  
  I will not be saved.

Save me  
  from my sins  
  from my fallen  
  from my own life  
  from my own righteousness 
  from myself

Save me, my God.

Amen
