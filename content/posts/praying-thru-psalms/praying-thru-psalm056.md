## The Psalm

>Psalm 56 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: according to “A Silent Dove Far Away.” A Miktam of David. When the Philistines seized him in Gath. 

><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, for a man is trampling me; he fights and oppresses me all day long. 

><sup>2</sup> My adversaries trample me all day, for many arrogantly fight against me. 

><sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I will trust in you. 

><sup>4</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me? 

><sup>5</sup> They twist my words all day long; all their thoughts against me are evil. 

><sup>6</sup> They stir up strife, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life. 

><sup>7</sup> Will they escape in spite of such sin? God, bring down the nations in wrath. 

><sup>8</sup> You yourself have recorded my wanderings. Put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book? 

><sup>9</sup> Then my enemies will retreat on the day when I call. This I know: God is for me. 

><sup>10</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise, 

><sup>11</sup> in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mere humans do to me? 

><sup>12</sup> I am obligated by vows to you, God; I will make my thanksgiving sacrifices to you. 

><sup>13</sup> For you rescued me from death, even my feet from stumbling, to walk before God in the light of life.

## The Prayer

You Are My Trust

```text
I have spent all of my life
Being scared
Being fearful of man
And worrying about what did they think of me

My eyes
were never
Where they should have been
They should have been fixated 
On the only one
Who answers my cries
quiets my soul
Cares for my heart
Loves me till the end
And brings me all the way home.

Breath life into me
When I turn away
And start to be anxious and fearing man
Man cannot save me
Man cannot soothe me
Man cannot save my soul
Only you, my Lord
Can save me
And love me
And heal me.

Be with me.

Amen.
```
