## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Trust
</div>

```text
I have spent all of my life
Being scared
Being fearful of man
And worrying about what did they think of me

My eyes
were never
Where they should have been
They should have been fixated 
On the only one
Who answers my cries
quiets my soul
Cares for my heart
Loves me till the end
And brings me all the way home.

Breath life into me
When I turn away
And start to be anxious and fearing man
Man cannot save me
Man cannot soothe me
Man cannot save my soul
Only you, my Lord
Can save me
And love me
And heal me.

Be with me.

Amen.
```
