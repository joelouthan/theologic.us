## The Psalms



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My God and Lord, </div>

```text
What blessings have you bestowed upon me,
  my unshakable foundation,
  my Solid Rock,
  my cornerstone,
  the one absolute love that will never be shaken.

But what is my response?
  I despise you
  I distrust you
  I think you will not be there for me.
And I turn to other gods,
  and other comforts,
  and wallow in my sins,
  and let despair rest upon my soul
But my beautiful Savior,
  you are the Shepherd who rescues the sheep,
  you are the Farmer who pulls the ox,
  you are the Christ that saves his people from their sin.
Once and for all times,
  definitely,
  completely,
  perfectly.
Blessed be your holy name forever.

Amen.


```
