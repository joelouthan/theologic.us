## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Remembrance
</div>

```text
Everything you have done
  in my life
  and the life of your people

Help me
  to remember you
  when I am weak
  and when I would perish
  you are the champion
  of the perishable.

You have come to save me
  and when I wander
  and lost again
  you will save me
  yet again.

Write your precious Scripture
  upon my heart
  so I might not sin
  against you
  you are my Rock and my Redeemer
  forever.

Amen.
```
