## The Psalm

>Psalm 37 (CSB)  
><sup>8</sup> Refrain from anger and give up your rage; do not be agitatedâ€”it can only bring harm. 

><sup>9</sup> For evildoers will be destroyed, but those who put their hope in the LORD will inherit the land. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only God
</div>

```text
I repent
  of a life that exacted
  vengeance for my wounds
  revenge for my pain
  justice for wrongs against me.

I repent for being wrathful.

You, O Lord, are the ONLY being
  deserving of justice
  because you have been wronged
  deserving of vengeance
  because you have been hurt
  wrathful
  because you are jealous for me.

Lord, I am repenting
  of when I thought I was you.

Beat this out of me
  make me your servant
  keep me as your friend
  love me as your lover
  Be my Lord and my God forever.

Amen.
```
