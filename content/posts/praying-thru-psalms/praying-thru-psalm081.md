## The Psalms

>Psalm 81 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>Sing for joy to God our strength; shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.

><sup> 2  </sup>Lift up a song—play the tambourine, the melodious lyre, and the harp.

><sup> 3  </sup>Blow the ram’s horn on the day of our feasts during the new moon and during the full moon.

><sup> 4  </sup>For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

><sup> 5  </sup>He set it up as a decree for Joseph when he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard an unfamiliar language:

><sup> 6  </sup>“I relieved his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from carrying the basket.

><sup> 7  </sup>You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the thundercloud. I tested you at the Waters of Meribah. Selah

><sup> 8  </sup>Listen, my people, and I will admonish you. Israel, if you would only listen to me!

><sup> 9  </sup>There must not be a strange god among you; you must not bow down to a foreign god.

><sup> 10  </sup>I am the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

><sup> 11  </sup>“But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel did not obey me.

><sup> 12  </sup>So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own plans.

><sup> 13  </sup>If only my people would listen to me and Israel would follow my ways,

><sup> 14  </sup>I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.”

><sup> 15  </sup>Those who hate the LORD would cower to him; their doom would last forever.

><sup> 16  </sup>But he would feed Israel with the best wheat. “I would satisfy you with honey from the rock.”

My your grace alone, I knew you when I was young. I knew you and did not love you nor run to you. I was infected by sin and kept turning to sin rather to the healer of my soul. I was broken and did not desire wholeness but rather to the despair that kept me broken. My heart was hardened and instead of crying for a new one, I kept it cold and frozen through my deeds and thoughts.

Still,
  you saved me.

You washed me clean of my sin
  in your precious Spirit.

You made me whole
  by the blood covering of your Son.

You took my dead heart
  and gave me your own soft heart.

This is what you have done.

You are my most precious Savior and Messiah.

You are my Lord and my God. Forever.

Amen.
