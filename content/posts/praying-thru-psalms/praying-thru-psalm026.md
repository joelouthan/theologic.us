## The Psalm

>Psalm 26 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, LORD, because I have lived with integrity and have trusted in the LORD without wavering. 

><sup>2</sup> Test me, LORD, and try me; examine my heart and mind. 

><sup>3</sup> For your faithful love guides me, and I live by your truth. 

><sup>4</sup> I do not sit with the worthless or associate with hypocrites. 

><sup>5</sup> I hate a crowd of evildoers, and I do not sit with the wicked. 

><sup>6</sup> I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, LORD, 

><sup>7</sup> raising my voice in thanksgiving and telling about your wondrous works. 

><sup>8</sup> LORD, I love the house where you dwell, the place where your glory resides. 

><sup>9</sup> Do not destroy me along with sinners, or my life along with men of bloodshed 

><sup>10</sup> in whose hands are evil schemes and whose right hands are filled with bribes. 

><sup>11</sup> But I live with integrity; redeem me and be gracious to me. 

><sup>12</sup> My foot stands on level ground; I will bless the LORD in the assemblies.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Beholder of my righteousness</div>

```text
You are my Lord,
  the defender of my heart
  the rescuer of my joy
  the protector of my life.

The world, life, Satan, and sin,
  might circle me
  might entrap me
  might try to take my life.

But you, O Lord, are my strength and shield.
  my ever present help
  my healing in my gaping wounds.

I do not be so presumptuous
  that I have anything good before you
  that my heart is upright in your presence
  that any of my deeds are good for you.

You are the one who set His affections upon me
  the one whose hands grabbed me
  the one whose strength pulled me close
  the one whose love will never let me go.

Be thou my righteousness forever.
  It is only you that I trust.
```
