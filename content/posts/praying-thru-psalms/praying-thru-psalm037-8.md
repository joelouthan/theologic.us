## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My One Avenger
</div>

```text
When I am hurt
  when people hurt me
  when they attack me
  when they do their worse.

Help me to take no offense
  to take my pain to you, O God
  because on your Son
  is all of my sin
  treason
  disease
  pain
  and suffering
  That belongs to you.

I will no longer live 
  on offense
  by angry
  by destruction
  by pain
  bv sin
  because you have called me to live in your Son alone

Be my love, O Lord.

I love you.

Amen
```
