## The Psalm

>Psalm 59 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. When Saul sent agents to watch the house and kill him. 

><sup>1</sup> Rescue me from my enemies, my God; protect me from those who rise up against me. 

><sup>2</sup> Rescue me from evildoers, and save me from men of bloodshed. 

><sup>3</sup> Because look, LORD, they set an ambush for me. Powerful men attack me, but not because of any sin or rebellion of mine. 

><sup>4</sup> For no fault of mine, they run and take up a position. Awake to help me, and take notice. 

><sup>5</sup> LORD God of Armies, you are the God of Israel. Rise up to punish all the nations; do not show favor to any wicked traitors. Selah 

><sup>6</sup> They return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city. 

><sup>7</sup> Look, they spew from their mouths— sharp words from their lips. “For who,” they say, “will hear?” 

><sup>8</sup> But you laugh at them, LORD; you ridicule all the nations. 

><sup>9</sup> I will keep watch for you, my strength, because God is my stronghold. 

><sup>10</sup> My faithful God will come to meet me; God will let me look down on my adversaries. 

><sup>11</sup> Do not kill them; otherwise, my people will forget. By your power, make them homeless wanderers and bring them down, Lord, our shield. 

><sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. They utter curses and lies. 

><sup>13</sup> Consume them in fury; consume them until they are gone. Then people will know throughout the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah 

><sup>14</sup> And they return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city. 

><sup>15</sup> They scavenge for food; they growl if they are not satisfied. 

><sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength and will joyfully proclaim your faithful love in the morning. For you have been a stronghold for me, a refuge in my day of trouble. 

><sup>17</sup> To you, my strength, I sing praises, because God is my stronghold— my faithful God.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Stronghold
</div>

```text
I pray
  that all of my sworn enemies
  have sought to destroy me
  kill me
  hurt me
  maim me
  torture me
  and weaken me
  that they would all
  be saved
  by your hand
  with your love
  in the blood of your Son
  by the power of your Spirit.

I will say this once
  because they are not my enemies
  but prisoners of war
  a war they cannot see
  and death is already upon them.

Be merciful to them, Lord,
  answer my prayer
  save them
  so we can worship you
  Almighty God
  for there is none like you.

I would like to see their face
  in the light of your love
  in the light of grace
  in the luxury of your mercy.

I love you Lord
  and I know you will save
  your people
  from their sins
  because all of what your Son
  has done for us.

Thank you.
I praise you.
Amen.
```
