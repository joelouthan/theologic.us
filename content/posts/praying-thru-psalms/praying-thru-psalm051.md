## The Psalm

>Psalm 51 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba. 

><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, according to your faithful love; according to your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion. 

><sup>2</sup> Completely wash away my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. 

><sup>3</sup> For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me. 

><sup>4</sup> Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight. So you are right when you pass sentence; you are blameless when you judge. 

><sup>5</sup> Indeed, I was guilty when I was born; I was sinful when my mother conceived me. 

><sup>6</sup> Surely you desire integrity in the inner self, and you teach me wisdom deep within. 

><sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 

><sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 

><sup>9</sup> Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. 

><sup>10</sup> God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 

><sup>11</sup> Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. 

><sup>12</sup> Restore the joy of your salvation to me, and sustain me by giving me a willing spirit. 

><sup>13</sup> Then I will teach the rebellious your ways, and sinners will return to you. 

><sup>14</sup> Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God— God of my salvation— and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. 

><sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. 

><sup>16</sup> You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; you are not pleased with a burnt offering. 

><sup>17</sup> The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God. 

><sup>18</sup> In your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build the walls of Jerusalem. 

><sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Restoration

```text
I cannot fall back into wickedness
  I cannot sin again
  I cannot be apart from you
  I cannot

I don't want to live
  If I cannot be in your presence
  You life is my life
  And I choose not to live without you.

Any sin left on my heart
  I need you wash it away
  Bring it up
  Give me the gift of repentance
  So I can turn away
  And turn to you.

Do this every moment of my life
  I have done everything
  The world
  My friends
  Work
  Satan
  Demons
  And sin
  Told me to go after
  And all of it is crap
  I find it wanting
  It is lacking

You have been the only thing
  That I have ever experienced
  That has given me perfection
  Perfect in love
  Grace
  mercy

You are better
  You are more
  You are righteous
  You are far above all of my gods.

I hate this world
  And I want nothing from it.

Take me home.
  Cleansed me of sin
  And take me home
  You are so good
  And there is nothing left here for me.

Amen.
