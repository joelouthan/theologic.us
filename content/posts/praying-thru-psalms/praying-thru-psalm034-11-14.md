## The Psalm

>Psalm 34 (CSB)  
><sup>11</sup> Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 

><sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life, loving a long life to enjoy what is good? 

><sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech. 

><sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do what is good; seek peace and pursue it. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My All-Good
</div>

```text
My lips have spoken evil
  because my heart was filled with wickedness.

My eyes saw lustful things
  because my heart was filled with sin.

My ears desired fleshy things
  because my heart was filled with cancer.

How can I even see good
  when I filled with evil and contempt?
  How can I even keep my tongue from evil and deceit
  when all I know is sin.
  How can I turn away from evil
  when all I have done is chase after my gods.

But you alone are good
  you alone bring peace
  and I dare not pursue you
  until you first capture me
  exchanged my heart
  gave me your faith
  gave me sight
  opened my ears
  changed my mind
  and gave me new desires.

Oh Lord,
  in your steadfast love
  grace upon grace
  and daily mercies
  capture my heart
  again and again
  keep my eyes on you
  and keep your precious word
  in my heart
  so that I will not sin against you.

Now, tomorrow and forever more.

I love you, Lord.
```
