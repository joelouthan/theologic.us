## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
You have made me a blessed man
  I am wealthy than the wealthiest combined
  I am stronger than a thousand strongmen
  I am wiser than Solomon

Because I have you
  you are my King Jesus
  you are my everything
  everything in this life
  if I have a little or a lot
  I have it all
  because you are my portion and my lot

  If I am weak or I am strong
  I have it all
  because you are the Almighty

  If I am insane or brilliant
  I have all wisdom
  because you give without hesitation

In you, my Christ
  my Father has given me so much
  that heaven and earth
  could give me 
  no more.

Amen.
```
