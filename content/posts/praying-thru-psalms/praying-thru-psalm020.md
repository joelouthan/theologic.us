```text
If I cry out for you, will you answer me?

If you alone made the provisions and the sacrifices, will you save me?

Even if I don’t understand you, will you reach for me?

I need you, Lord. I don’t even have the wisdom to reach my hands up to you.

I want you, God, and my heart is still filled with sin and wickedness.

I have you, my Lord and my God, because I have your Spirit within me all because of what Your Son has done for me.

Help me, God, help me.

Save me.

Amen
