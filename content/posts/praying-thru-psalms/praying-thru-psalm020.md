## The Psalm

>Psalm 20 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> May the LORD answer you in a day of trouble; may the name of Jacob’s God protect you. 

><sup>2</sup> May he send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion. 

><sup>3</sup> May he remember all your offerings and accept your burnt offering. Selah 

><sup>4</sup> May he give you what your heart desires and fulfill your whole purpose. 

><sup>5</sup> Let us shout for joy at your victory and lift the banner in the name of our God. May the LORD fulfill all your requests. 

><sup>6</sup> Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with mighty victories from his right hand. 

><sup>7</sup> Some take pride in chariots, and others in horses, but we take pride in the name of the LORD our God. 

><sup>8</sup> They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm. 

><sup>9</sup> LORD, give victory to the king! May he answer us on the day that we call.

## The Prayer

```text
If I cry out for you, will you answer me?

If you alone made the provisions and the sacrifices, will you save me?

Even if I don’t understand you, will you reach for me?

I need you, Lord. I don’t even have the wisdom to reach my hands up to you.

I want you, God, and my heart is still filled with sin and wickedness.

I have you, my Lord and my God, because I have your Spirit within me all because of what Your Son has done for me.

Help me, God, help me.

Save me.

Amen
