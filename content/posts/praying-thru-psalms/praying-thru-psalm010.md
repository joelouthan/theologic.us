## The Psalm

>Psalm 10 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> LORD, why do you stand so far away? Why do you hide in times of trouble? 

><sup>2</sup> In arrogance the wicked relentlessly pursue their victims; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised. 

><sup>3</sup> For the wicked one boasts about his own cravings; the one who is greedy curses and despises the LORD. 

><sup>4</sup> In all his scheming, the wicked person arrogantly thinks, “There’s no accountability, since there’s no God.” 

><sup>5</sup> His ways are always secure; your lofty judgments have no effect on him; he scoffs at all his adversaries. 

><sup>6</sup> He says to himself, “I will never be moved— from generation to generation I will be without calamity.” 

><sup>7</sup> Cursing, deceit, and violence fill his mouth; trouble and malice are under his tongue. 

><sup>8</sup> He waits in ambush near settlements; he kills the innocent in secret places. His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless; 

><sup>9</sup> he lurks in secret like a lion in a thicket. He lurks in order to seize a victim; he seizes a victim and drags him in his net. 

><sup>10</sup> So he is oppressed and beaten down; helpless people fall because of the wicked one’s strength. 

><sup>11</sup> He says to himself, “God has forgotten; he hides his face and will never see.” 

><sup>12</sup> Rise up, LORD God! Lift up your hand. Do not forget the oppressed. 

><sup>13</sup> Why has the wicked person despised God? He says to himself, “You will not demand an account.” 

><sup>14</sup> But you yourself have seen trouble and grief, observing it in order to take the matter into your hands. The helpless one entrusts himself to you; you are a helper of the fatherless. 

><sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked, evil person, until you look for his wickedness, but it can’t be found. 

><sup>16</sup> The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations will perish from his land. 

><sup>17</sup> LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble; you will strengthen their hearts. You will listen carefully, 

><sup>18</sup> doing justice for the fatherless and the oppressed so that mere humans from the earth may terrify them no more.

  O Lord,

```text
My sin wakes me up from my slumber.

At my weakest, my iniquities flood my mind.
  My mind is not sharp.
  My soul is asleep.
  In the pitch blackness of the night, I cannot see.
  
Sin is like a ravenous, 
  rabid dog who sits upon my chest, 
  waiting to devour me. 
  I can smell it’s breath. 
  I can taste the poison stench. 
  My eardrums break from the deafening bark.

My birth and my life before haunts me.

But you, O Lord, are my Shepherd. 
  You are my protector.
  You are my defender.
  You are my avenger.
  You are my slayer.

You, 
  who was once slain for my sin, 
  have already gloriously, 
  majestically, 
  violently, 
  powerfully, 
  and mercilessly 
  slay all of my sin.

My King,
  my wits are lost. 
  My soul is dormant. 
  My heart is nearly still. 
  I do not have the wisdom to ask for help. 
  I do not have the presence of mind to call on you.

My God, 
  be my faithful protector—
  continuously 
  and forevermore.

Every waking moment and every minute of sleep, 
there is not a time when I don’t need you.

I need you, God. 
  Don’t leave me. 
  Stay with me. 
  Help me. 
  Love me. 
  Care for me.

I love you.

In the incredible name of Your Son, I pray.

Amen.
```
