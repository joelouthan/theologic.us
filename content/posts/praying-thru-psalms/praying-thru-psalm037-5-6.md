## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My One Commitment
</div>

```text
I love you Lord
  and you are my heart's desire
  for all of my days
  I want to be by your side
  and dwell with you
  and waste my days with you
  because you are the Lord of my life
  and the love of my heart.

How amazing
  that you would look upon
  my sinful heart
  and thought of love at first sight
  there is none like you
  there is none beside you
  I stake all of my hope and trust in you
  you are my God and my Lord forever
  you are the center and totality of my heart
  you are my will and my desire.

God,
  keep me close
  never let me go
  don't loosen your grip on me
  because I couldn't stand it
  and I rather die
  then to be apart from you.
  Because if I do,
  then I will be with you.

Be my God.
  Be my sweetest affections
  and my deepest joy
  and my fieriest passions.

I will praise you.

Amen.
```
