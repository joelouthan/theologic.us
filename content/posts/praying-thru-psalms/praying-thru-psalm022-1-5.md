## The Psalm

>Psalm 22:1–5 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you so far from my deliverance and from my words of groaning? 

><sup>2</sup> My God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, by night, yet I have no rest. 

><sup>3</sup> But you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 

><sup>4</sup> Our ancestors trusted in you; they trusted, and you rescued them. 

><sup>5</sup> They cried to you and were set free; they trusted in you and were not disgraced.

Where are you?

I am in trouble!

Sin and wickedness have surrounded me.
  Everything goes dark and cold. 
  Satan and his minions 
  look upon my flesh with lust and hunger.

Temptations are too much. 
  I cannot do battle. 
  My muscles are weak, small, and frail.

I cry and scream: HELP ME, O GOD!

But you are my powerful Champion. 
  You are the people’s Savior. 
  You are invincible. 
  You are forever strong.

I have praised you in the past 
  and my lips shall sing of your praises 
  for as long as I draw breath and beyond.

Your people before me 
  trusted you 
  and I trust you now. 
  You have never failed me. 
  Even when there have been moments 
  when I didn’t know your goodness, 
  you were always good.

You have rescued my grandmother and my dad.

Now rescue me!

Save me, O God.

My life is in your hands.
