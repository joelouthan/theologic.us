## The Psalm

>Psalm 27 (CSB)  

><sup>7</sup> LORD, hear my voice when I call; be gracious to me and answer me. 

><sup>8</sup> My heart says this about you: “Seek his face.” LORD, I will seek your face. 

><sup>9</sup> Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or abandon me, God of my salvation. 

><sup>10</sup> Even if my father and mother abandon me, the LORD cares for me. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O Lord</div>

```text
Every single adult who were suppose to love me and care for me
  did not.

My father raped me.
My mother abandoned me.
My grandmother threw me to the wolves.
My step-mother neglected and beat me.

But you, O Lord, have never stopped loving me,
  even when everybody else has.

You have called me into this world,
  only to glorify you.

You have declared that I am in the world and not of the world.
  so let the world become dark and grotesque in my eyes
  so that my eyes would stare deeply in your glorious light.

My God, save me.
  take me home
  to be with you forever.

Amen.
```
