  Dear Lord,
</div>

```text
I will not and cannot list what I _think_ you have not done for me. That is preposterous! What you have done for me, in me, and through me is too great to even list. But I thank you so much. I thank you for you are absolutely good, absolutely merciful, absolutely gracious, and absolutely love. These I know of you and know you well.

God, you are high and exalted far above all creation, including any little thing I might create with my mind and my hands. I thank you for those many gifts that you have given me. I thank you for the life that you have given me. I thank you for the loves that you have given me. I thank you all.

God, I thank you for the security of your word. I thank you that you cannot break your promises to me. And those promises apply to me because I am your son, of whom you said you are well-pleased. Your Spirit also bears witness with my spirit that I am your child. Your Son intercedes for me on my behalf.  I know you will not reject me but you have saved me to yourself for your everlasting glory and the fullness of my joy.

God, I thank you for your heart that you have given to me. So now, with my voice, my lungs, my mouth, and my heart, I sing. I sing to you, about you, and for you. I sing loudly. I sing because I want you to hear me. I sing because I want you to hear how much I love you. And you hear my song. And you always hear my song.

May my words be a sweet and lovely sound for your ears.

I love you.

I adore you.

Thank you.

In your Son’s incredible name I pray.
Amen.
