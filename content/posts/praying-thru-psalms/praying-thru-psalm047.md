## The Psalm

>Psalm 47 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

><sup>1</sup> Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with a jubilant cry. 

><sup>2</sup> For the LORD, the Most High, is awe-inspiring, a great King over the whole earth. 

><sup>3</sup> He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet. 

><sup>4</sup> He chooses for us our inheritance— the pride of Jacob, whom he loves. Selah 

><sup>5</sup> God ascends among shouts of joy, the LORD, with the sound of a ram’s horn. 

><sup>6</sup> Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise! 

><sup>7</sup> Sing a song of wisdom, for God is King of the whole earth. 

><sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne. 

><sup>9</sup> The nobles of the peoples have assembled with the people of the God of Abraham. For the leaders of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Dwelling
</div>

```text
I will sing
  of all of your done
  of your salvation of my soul
  of your goodness to me
  of your provision when I have nothing
  of your presence when I was alone.

I will proclaim
  that you alone are good
  that you alone are righteous
  that you alone are worthy
  that you alone are holy
  holy
  holy.

I will preach
  that Christ came to save sinners
  of whom I am the foremost
  that Christ came to save His people
  from their sins
  that Christ is gentle and lowly
  and will take our sins
  of Christ alone
  and him crucified.

I will confess
  with a changed heart
  and a renewed mind
  and with your Spirit within me
  and your Son who died for me
  of all of my sins
  that you are God alone
  there is none like you.

I will live
  unto you alone
  because you are my precious God
  and my Lord
  forevermore.

Amen.
