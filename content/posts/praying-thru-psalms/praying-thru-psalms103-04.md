## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
For all of my
  troubling sin
  wicked perversion
  grotesque behavior
  slothfulness
  anger
  I should have perish
  I should be under the wrath of your Son
  I should have been counted with the worthless

I should have
  because everything about me
  was at war with you

But you have been my God
  before I was even a thought in my mother's womb
  you have molded time and space
  and your Son entered into creation
  to save a wretched outcast like me

You have delivered me from sin
  and you have removed my transgressions
  but you have not gone back in time
  and removed the hurt I have caused
  and the hurt and pain that I have endured

You alone
  have made it worthwhile
  the evil I have felt and dealt
  you have turned it into good
  because your Son died on the cross
  to reconcile creation to himself
  for good.

I praise you
  because you alone
  have loved me.

Amen
```
