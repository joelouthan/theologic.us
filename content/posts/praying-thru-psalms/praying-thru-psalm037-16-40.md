## The Psalm

>Psalm 37 (CSB)  
><sup>16</sup> The little that the righteous person has is better than the abundance of many wicked people. 

><sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD supports the righteous. 

><sup>18</sup> The LORD watches over the blameless all their days, and their inheritance will last forever. 

><sup>19</sup> They will not be disgraced in times of adversity; they will be satisfied in days of hunger. 

><sup>20</sup> But the wicked will perish; the LORD’s enemies, like the glory of the pastures, will fade away— they will fade away like smoke. 

><sup>21</sup> The wicked person borrows and does not repay, but the righteous one is gracious and giving. 

><sup>22</sup> Those who are blessed by the LORD will inherit the land, but those cursed by him will be destroyed. 

><sup>23</sup> A person’s steps are established by the LORD, and he takes pleasure in his way. 

><sup>24</sup> Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, because the LORD supports him with his hand. 

><sup>25</sup> I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his children begging for bread. 

><sup>26</sup> He is always generous, always lending, and his children are a blessing. 

><sup>27</sup> Turn away from evil, do what is good, and settle permanently. 

><sup>28</sup> For the LORD loves justice and will not abandon his faithful ones. They are kept safe forever, but the children of the wicked will be destroyed. 

><sup>29</sup> The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it permanently. 

><sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom; his tongue speaks what is just. 

><sup>31</sup> The instruction of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter. 

><sup>32</sup> The wicked one lies in wait for the righteous and intends to kill him; 

><sup>33</sup> the LORD will not leave him in the power of the wicked one or allow him to be condemned when he is judged. 

><sup>34</sup> Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land. You will watch when the wicked are destroyed. 

><sup>35</sup> I have seen a wicked, violent person well-rooted, like a flourishing native tree. 

><sup>36</sup> Then I passed by and noticed he was gone; I searched for him, but he could not be found. 

><sup>37</sup> Watch the blameless and observe the upright, for the person of peace will have a future. 

><sup>38</sup> But transgressors will all be eliminated; the future of the wicked will be destroyed. 

><sup>39</sup> The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD, their refuge in a time of distress. 

><sup>40</sup> The LORD helps and delivers them; he will deliver them from the wicked and will save them because they take refuge in him.

My Only Gift of Righteousness

```text
All of my days
  were filled with evil
  treason
  unholiness
  vile
  and dread before you.

I was once
  foolish
  disobedient
  led astray
  a slave to various passions
  and pleasures
  passing my days in malice
  and envy
  hated by others
  and hating others.

But when you appeared,
  O Lord
  you brought your goodness
  and loving kindness
  and you saved me
  Not because of anything I have ever done
  or will ever do
  but only because of your great mercy
  and you washed me
  my giving me a clean heart
  and filling me richly
  with your Holy Spirit.

And now I am justified
  by your grace
  and now I am heir
  because you are only hope
  for eternal life.

Be thou my vision
  forever.

Amen.
