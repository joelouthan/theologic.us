## The Psalm

>Psalm 103:6 (CSB) The LORD executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
No matter what sin
  and evil is against me
  you are always
  my Lord and my God
  forever

There is no wickedness left
  on this world
  by mankind
  that can rail against me
  because I have you alone
  forever

But it is not the trespasses of the world
  that will cause me to fall away
  it is my own depravity
  that will cause me to wander

But you have given me
  your Son's righteousness
  and now
  you are my hope and stay.
  I have you
  because
  you have me
  forever

Be exalted, O Lord
  in my life
  today

Amen
```
