## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

```text
There was a time
  when I thought I knew of your word
  because I glanced through the pages
  or I took a couple weeks of intently reading
  and then crown myself
  an expert on what you have said

But I was foolish
  and always disobedient
  to what you have told me to do

But if my eyes were opened
  and my ears were unstopped
  and my heart was soft
  and my mind was renewed
  and my soul alive
  and your Spirit was in me

Then I would have heard one word
  from your lips
  and been transformed
  and been made whole
  and would have believed.

And I would have known
  your sweetest mercies
  your whelming grace
  your unending love
  and your kindness
  and forgiveness
  for my wrongdoings

But now I know
  and you are
  and I am yours
  and you are mine
  forever.

Amen.
```
