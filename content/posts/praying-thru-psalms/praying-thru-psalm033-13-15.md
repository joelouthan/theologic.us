## The Psalm

>Psalm 33 (CSB)  
><sup>13</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven; he observes everyone.

><sup>15</sup> He forms the hearts of them all; he considers all their works. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My God
</div>

```text
I know that all of mankind
  will wonder into ungodliness 
  will stray into wickedness
  and by their own sin,
  fall away in ignorance. 

I was once
  atheistic
  evil
  blasphemous
  ignorant in unbelief

But yet
  You gave me more grace
  with the faith and love
  that can only be found 
  in your Son.

My God,
  we know that you see us
  you know we are not good
  we know that you do not overlord us
  to condemn us
  But youâ€™ve sent your Son
  to save us.

My Lord,
  Be merciful to me
  Give me grace beyond measure
  Never remove your Spirit from me 
  Never end your steadfast love for me
  Do not forsake me
  Do not forget me
  Just be with me

You are worthy to be praised. Forever.

Amen.
```
