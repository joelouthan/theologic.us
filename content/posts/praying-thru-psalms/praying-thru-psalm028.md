## The Psalm

>Psalm 28 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 

><sup>1</sup> LORD, I call to you; my rock, do not be deaf to me. If you remain silent to me, I will be like those going down to the Pit. 

><sup>2</sup> Listen to the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary. 

><sup>3</sup> Do not drag me away with the wicked, with the evildoers, who speak in friendly ways with their neighbors while malice is in their hearts. 

><sup>4</sup> Repay them according to what they have doneâ€” according to the evil of their deeds. Repay them according to the work of their hands; give them back what they deserve. 

><sup>5</sup> Because they do not consider what the LORD has done or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and not rebuild them. 

><sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, for he has heard the sound of my pleading. 

><sup>7</sup> The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart celebrates, and I give thanks to him with my song. 

><sup>8</sup> The LORD is the strength of his people; he is a stronghold of salvation for his anointed. 

><sup>9</sup> Save your people, bless your possession, shepherd them, and carry them forever.

How many times, my God,
  must you rescue me?

How many times, O Lord,
  will you come running
  when I call your name?

But I am wicked and violent man,
  and violence has me surrounded on all sides?

But you, O my Lord, rescued me
  saved me
  because you loved me
  from the very beginning.
I need you, Lord,
  now more than ever.
I am in desperate need of your hand
  to rescue me
  from despair
  and violence.
Be my blessed Rock
  forever. Amen.

```
