## The Psalm

>Psalm 50 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of Asaph. 

><sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks; he summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. 

><sup>2</sup> From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God appears in radiance. 

><sup>3</sup> Our God is coming; he will not be silent! Devouring fire precedes him, and a storm rages around him. 

><sup>4</sup> On high, he summons heaven and earth in order to judge his people: 

><sup>5</sup> “Gather my faithful ones to me, those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 

><sup>6</sup> The heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God is the Judge. Selah 

><sup>7</sup> “Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel. I am God, your God. 

><sup>8</sup> I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or for your burnt offerings, which are continually before me. 

><sup>9</sup> I will not take a bull from your household or male goats from your pens, 

><sup>10</sup> for every animal of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. 

><sup>11</sup> I know every bird of the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine. 

><sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and everything in it is mine. 

><sup>13</sup> Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 

><sup>14</sup> Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice to God, and pay your vows to the Most High. 

><sup>15</sup> Call on me in a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor me.” 

><sup>16</sup> But God says to the wicked: “What right do you have to recite my statutes and to take my covenant on your lips? 

><sup>17</sup> You hate instruction and fling my words behind you. 

><sup>18</sup> When you see a thief, you make friends with him, and you associate with adulterers. 

><sup>19</sup> You unleash your mouth for evil and harness your tongue for deceit. 

><sup>20</sup> You sit, maligning your brother, slandering your mother’s son. 

><sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But I will rebuke you and lay out the case before you. 

><sup>22</sup> “Understand this, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and there will be no one to rescue you. 

><sup>23</sup> Whoever offers a thanksgiving sacrifice honors me, and whoever orders his conduct, I will show him the salvation of God.”

## The Prayer

You Are My Judge

```text
My sins before you
  can stretch to the furthest galaxies
  can fill the oceans
  can corrupt my soul
  can tangle my flesh
  can rot my mind
  can breaks my heart
  can steal any love I have in me.

At one time
  you counted me wicked
  because I was wicked
  I was treasonous
  because I made war against you
  with my mind
  my heart
  and my desires.

But you, O God
  in your great mercies
  and your lavish grace
  gave me your Son
  to live and die
  in my place
  for my sins.

You granted me a new heart
  your Spirit
  new desires
  for you.

You have given me faith
  to exalt you
  to worship you
  to run to you
  to lay at your feet
  to hope in you
  to trust in you
  to obey your every word.

Keep your love on me
  Do not let me stray
  I do not want to lose you love
  you are all that I have
  I have nothing else
  where else can I go.

Be exalted, my Lord.

Amen.
```
