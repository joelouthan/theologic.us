## The Psalm

>Psalm 89 (CSB)  
> A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. 

><sup> 1  </sup>I will sing about the LORD’s faithful love forever; I will proclaim your faithfulness to all generations with my mouth. 

><sup> 2  </sup>For I will declare, “Faithful love is built up forever; you establish your faithfulness in the heavens.” 

><sup> 3  </sup>The LORD said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn an oath to David my servant: 

><sup> 4  </sup>‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’ ” Selah 

><sup> 5  </sup>LORD, the heavens praise your wonders— your faithfulness also— in the assembly of the holy ones. 

><sup> 6  </sup>For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD? 

><sup> 7  </sup>God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, more awe-inspiring than all who surround him. 

><sup> 8  </sup>LORD God of Armies, who is strong like you, LORD? Your faithfulness surrounds you. 

><sup> 9  </sup>You rule the raging sea; when its waves surge, you still them. 

><sup> 10  </sup>You crushed Rahab like one who is slain; you scattered your enemies with your powerful arm. 

><sup> 11  </sup>The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours. The world and everything in it—you founded them. 

><sup> 12  </sup>North and south—you created them. Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at your name. 

><sup> 13  </sup>You have a mighty arm; your hand is powerful; your right hand is lifted high. 

><sup> 14  </sup>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; faithful love and truth go before you. 

><sup> 15  </sup>Happy are the people who know the joyful shout; LORD, they walk in the light from your face. 

><sup> 16  </sup>They rejoice in your name all day long, and they are exalted by your righteousness. 

><sup> 17  </sup>For you are their magnificent strength; by your favor our horn is exalted. 

><sup> 18  </sup>Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

><sup> 19  </sup>You once spoke in a vision to your faithful ones and said, “I have granted help to a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 

><sup> 20  </sup>I have found David my servant; I have anointed him with my sacred oil. 

><sup> 21  </sup>My hand will always be with him, and my arm will strengthen him. 

><sup> 22  </sup>The enemy will not oppress him; the wicked will not afflict him. 

><sup> 23  </sup>I will crush his foes before him and strike those who hate him. 

><sup> 24  </sup>My faithfulness and love will be with him, and through my name his horn will be exalted. 

><sup> 25  </sup>I will extend his power to the sea and his right hand to the rivers. 

><sup> 26  </sup>He will call to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the rock of my salvation.’ 

><sup> 27  </sup>I will also make him my firstborn, greatest of the kings of the earth. 

><sup> 28  </sup>I will always preserve my faithful love for him, and my covenant with him will endure. 

><sup> 29  </sup>I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as heaven lasts. 

><sup> 30  </sup>If his sons abandon my instruction and do not live by my ordinances, 

><sup> 31  </sup>if they dishonor my statutes and do not keep my commands, 

><sup> 32  </sup>then I will call their rebellion to account with the rod, their iniquity with blows. 

><sup> 33  </sup>But I will not withdraw my faithful love from him or betray my faithfulness. 

><sup> 34  </sup>I will not violate my covenant or change what my lips have said. 

><sup> 35  </sup>Once and for all I have sworn an oath by my holiness; I will not lie to David. 

><sup> 36  </sup>His offspring will continue forever, his throne like the sun before me, 

><sup> 37  </sup>like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah 

><sup> 38  </sup>But you have spurned and rejected him; you have become enraged with your anointed. 

><sup> 39  </sup>You have repudiated the covenant with your servant; you have completely dishonored his crown. 

><sup> 40  </sup>You have broken down all his walls; you have reduced his fortified cities to ruins. 

><sup> 41  </sup>All who pass by plunder him; he has become an object of ridicule to his neighbors. 

><sup> 42  </sup>You have lifted high the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice. 

><sup> 43  </sup>You have also turned back his sharp sword and have not let him stand in battle. 

><sup> 44  </sup>You have made his splendor cease and have overturned his throne. 

><sup> 45  </sup>You have shortened the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah 

><sup> 46  </sup>How long, LORD? Will you hide forever? Will your anger keep burning like fire? 

><sup> 47  </sup>Remember how short my life is. Have you created everyone for nothing? 

><sup> 48  </sup>What courageous person can live and never see death? Who can save himself from the power of Sheol? Selah 

><sup> 49  </sup>Lord, where are the former acts of your faithful love that you swore to David in your faithfulness? 

><sup> 50  </sup>Remember, Lord, the ridicule against your servants— in my heart I carry abuse from all the peoples— 

><sup> 51  </sup>how your enemies have ridiculed, LORD, how they have ridiculed every step of your anointed. 

><sup> 52  </sup>Blessed be the LORD forever. Amen and amen.

## The Prayer

```text
I know that
  you are my eternity to eternity
  the steadfast love that has always been there
  you have created time and space and material
  you have created north and south and east and west
  you have created height and depth and width and breadth
  you have created physics

You have created thought
  the will, the heart, the emotion
  the power, the bend, the direction
  the start of study, science, knowledge, and wisdom
  you have created philosophy

Yet, you have begotten your Son
  who was from eternity to eternity
  who loved me before creation
  who saw my wickedness and sin
  who was born into my world
  who lived for me
  who died for me
  who was raised so I could live
  and be with you forever.

It is not that I have kept you
  because I have ran away a million times
  sinned against you a trillion times more
  warred against you with every fiber of my being
  and would soon descend into hell then to see you.

But you have kept me
  from before the beginning
  through creation
  through the fall of my parents
  throughout all time
  throughout the ages
  through wars and rumors of wars
  through the raising and lowering of kings
  through the building and wiping of nations
  through it all
  you have kept me close to your bosom.

Keep me everlasting to everlasting
  from reach of your hand
  to the depths of your heart
  keep me always in your love.
