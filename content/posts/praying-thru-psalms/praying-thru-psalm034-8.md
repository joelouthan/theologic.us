Infinite holder of my infinite space

```text
I have sought all of my life
  to prey on the weak
  to consume to my stomach's content
  to try to fill my heart
  with everything
  my sin's desires
  the world and it's pleasures
  the sweetest temptations of the devil

My God,
  you knew me
  and loved me
  you sought me
  and rescued me
  when I was in the mud
  at the bottom of the ocean
  and was dead in my trespasses.

Your arm
  none too short
  reached in
  carried me up
  took me to green pastures
  laid me besides still waters
  restored my soul
  for your name sake only.

Feed my body
  be my forever sustenance
  be my forever strength
  be my forever shield
  be my forever salvation.

In you, will I trust.
```
