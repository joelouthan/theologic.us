## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Gift of Righteousness
</div>

```text
All of my days
  were filled with evil
  treason
  unholiness
  vile
  and dread before you.

I was once
  foolish
  disobedient
  led astray
  a slave to various passions
  and pleasures
  passing my days in malice
  and envy
  hated by others
  and hating others.

But when you appeared,
  O Lord
  you brought your goodness
  and loving kindness
  and you saved me
  Not because of anything I have ever done
  or will ever do
  but only because of your great mercy
  and you washed me
  my giving me a clean heart
  and filling me richly
  with your Holy Spirit.

And now I am justified
  by your grace
  and now I am heir
  because you are only hope
  for eternal life.

Be thou my vision
  forever.

Amen.
```
