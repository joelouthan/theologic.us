## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Righteousness
</div>

```text
I search this earth
  for something that is good and holy
  none I can find
  I see semblances
  but none fulfilling.

But you led me to your word
  and your word speaks of you.

I see that you alone are good
  holy
  justified
  merciful
  gracious
  loving
  and righteous.

And we are so far from you
  I even see my own heart
  and I am an infinite distant
  from your presence.

Who would bridge this gap?

Is it I?
  Then, let me try my best
  let me abstain from sin
  let me not look at porn
  let me not lust after someone eclipses
  let me not steal
  let me not life
  let me not swell in pride
  let me fail not in helping those in need
  let me do good1

Oh but everything I do is infected with sin.

I see it because I know it in my heart.

When I am helpful,
  I do so in order for people to like me.
When I am nice,
  I want people to think I am good.

But if they could see my heart
  if they could see the thoughts of my minds
  that sin runs continuously
  that wickedness runs without end
  that treason is built into my soul
  and they judge me wanting.

But you saw the depths of my soul
  even beyond what I can see
  in the darkness and despair
  and you did not cower
  you did not look away
  you took pity on this old fool
  and you gave me your Son
  and you gave me your Spirit
  and you gave me your inheritance
  your daily mercies
  your sweetest grace
  and your steadfast love.

Keep me in palms of your hands O Lord
  I stand on the spoken word of your Son
  that no one
  not anything
  even sin
  Satan
  death
  demons
  and hell
  can take me from your hand

Furthermore,
  my God
  you would never let me go.

Keep me in your heart
  and speak into my soul
  and write your words in my heart
  that I may never sin against you.
```
