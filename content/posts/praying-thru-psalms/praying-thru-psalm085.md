## The Psalm

>Psalm 85 (CSB)  
> For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 

><sup> 1 </sup> LORD, you showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob. 

><sup> 2 </sup> You forgave your peopleâ€™s guilt; you covered all their sin. Selah 

><sup> 3 </sup> You withdrew all your fury; you turned from your burning anger. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Return to us, God of our salvation, and abandon your displeasure with us. 

><sup> 5 </sup> Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger for all generations? 

><sup> 6 </sup> Will you not revive us again so that your people may rejoice in you? 

><sup> 7 </sup> Show us your faithful love, LORD, and give us your salvation. 

><sup> 8 </sup> I will listen to what God will say; surely the LORD will declare peace to his people, his faithful ones, and not let them go back to foolish ways. 

><sup> 9 </sup> His salvation is very near those who fear him, so that glory may dwell in our land. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Faithful love and truth will join together; righteousness and peace will embrace. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Truth will spring up from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven. 

><sup> 12 </sup> Also, the LORD will provide what is good, and our land will yield its crops. 

><sup> 13 </sup> Righteousness will go before him to prepare the way for his steps.

Just as you looked upon Noah
  saw his wickedness
  foolishness
  worthlessness
  and depravity

  you looked upon my sins
  and counted them up
  and they are endless
  and every one of my sins
  was treasonous act
  against your holiness

But just as you looked upon Noah
  and gave him grace
  you looked upon my estate
  and gave me grace
  I did nothing to deserve it
  I did everything to reject it
  but still you loved me
  knew me
  and saved me.

There will be one day
  I will stand in front of your precious Son
  and the account of my sins will be listed off
  and others' sins will not compare to my own
  because I am the chief of sinners

Call my sins out
  every last one of them
  because even it was one sin or a billionth sin
  I will still need Your only begotten Son
  Jesus Christ
  to forgive me of all of my sins
  and to cleanse me of all unrighteousness
  to remove my transgressions as far as the east is from the west

I am in desperate need
  of the grace that only Christ can give.

Name my sins
  so even my wickedness
  will glorify His name
  because salvation belongs to the Lord
  You are the only one mighty to save me.
