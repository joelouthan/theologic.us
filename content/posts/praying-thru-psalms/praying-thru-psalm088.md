## The Psalm
>Psalm 88 (CSB)  
> A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite. 

><sup> 1 </sup> LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out before you day and night. 

><sup> 2 </sup> May my prayer reach your presence; listen to my cry. 

><sup> 3 </sup> For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol. 

><sup> 4 </sup> I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength, 

><sup> 5 </sup> abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom you no longer remember, and who are cut off from your care. 

><sup> 6 </sup> You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths. 

><sup> 7 </sup> Your wrath weighs heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah 

><sup> 8 </sup> You have distanced my friends from me; you have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out. 

><sup> 9 </sup> My eyes are worn out from crying. LORD, I cry out to you all day long; I spread out my hands to you. 

><sup> 10 </sup> Do you work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise you? Selah 

><sup> 11 </sup> Will your faithful love be declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Abaddon? 

><sup> 12 </sup> Will your wonders be known in the darkness or your righteousness in the land of oblivion? 

><sup> 13 </sup> But I call to you for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer meets you. 

><sup> 14 </sup> LORD, why do you reject me? Why do you hide your face from me? 

><sup> 15 </sup> From my youth, I have been suffering and near death. I suffer your horrors; I am desperate. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Your wrath sweeps over me; your terrors destroy me. 

><sup> 17 </sup> They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side. 

><sup> 18 </sup> You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my only friend.

```text
From the moment, I laid dead in the pit of hell
  in the death of my own sin
  in the torment of sins against me
  in the agony of my trespasses
  in the torture of my soul
  and my eyes closed
  and I could not move
  and lay
  and I am dead.

You gave me life
  and your light shined into my soul
  your actions wiped my wickedness away
  your grace gave me hope
  your death gave me your life
  your life is my worship to you in heaven forever.

You are the God
  who instantly saves.

Be glorified in my life today.
```
