## The Psalm

>Psalm 25 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 

><sup>1</sup> LORD, I appeal to you. 

><sup>2</sup> My God, I trust in you. Do not let me be disgraced; do not let my enemies gloat over me. 

><sup>3</sup> No one who waits for you will be disgraced; those who act treacherously without cause will be disgraced. 

><sup>4</sup> Make your ways known to me, LORD; teach me your paths. 

><sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; I wait for you all day long. 

><sup>6</sup> Remember, LORD, your compassion and your faithful love, for they have existed from antiquity. 

><sup>7</sup> Do not remember the sins of my youth or my acts of rebellion; in keeping with your faithful love, remember me because of your goodness, LORD. 

><sup>8</sup> The LORD is good and upright; therefore he shows sinners the way. 

><sup>9</sup> He leads the humble in what is right and teaches them his way. 

><sup>10</sup> All the LORDâ€™s ways show faithful love and truth to those who keep his covenant and decrees. 

><sup>11</sup> LORD, for the sake of your name, forgive my iniquity, for it is immense. 

><sup>12</sup> Who is this person who fears the LORD? He will show him the way he should choose. 

><sup>13</sup> He will live a good life, and his descendants will inherit the land. 

><sup>14</sup> The secret counsel of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he reveals his covenant to them. 

><sup>15</sup> My eyes are always on the LORD, for he will pull my feet out of the net. 

><sup>16</sup> Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am alone and afflicted. 

><sup>17</sup> The distresses of my heart increase; bring me out of my sufferings. 

><sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and trouble, and forgive all my sins. 

><sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies; they are numerous, and they hate me violently. 

><sup>20</sup> Guard me and rescue me; do not let me be disgraced, for I take refuge in you. 

><sup>21</sup> May integrity and what is right watch over me, for I wait for you. 

><sup>22</sup> God, redeem Israel, from all its distresses.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Steadfast Lover</div>

```text
My enemies have long shamed me
  and I have been beaten to death.
  I have decided, "My Lord is not for me,
  I have been forsaken."

"There is nothing left for me,
  there is none I am call to.
  Let me waste away to death
  and turn back into dust."

But You, O Lord, have been my God,
  since before I was in my mother's womb.
  Since then, I have been hurt and afflicted,
  left confused and driven to desperation.
  I was throughly convinced,
  It was better for me to be stillborn.

My God, you are my Rescuer and Redeemer.
  There is none like you.
  You do not simply remove me from evil,
  but you bring me high and lifted up to you.

And I have seen your glory,
  and my life I dismiss as shit,
  in comparison of knowing you,
  and being called your beloved.

Do not stop rescuing me.
  Keep me in your presence.
  And draw my heart towards you.
```
