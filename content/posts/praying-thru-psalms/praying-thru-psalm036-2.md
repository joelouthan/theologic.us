## The Prayer

My Only Path
</div>

```text
I search this earth
  for something that is good and holy
  none I can find
  I see semblances
  but none fulfilling

But you lead me to your word
  your word speaks of you
  I see that you alone are good
  holy
  justified
  merciful
  gracious
  loving
  righteous
  we are so far from you

I see my own heart
  I am an infinite distance from your presence.

Who would bridge this gap?

Is it I?

Let me try my best
  let me abstain from sin
  let me not look at porn
  let me not lust after someone eclipses
  let me not steal 
  let me not life
  let me not swell in predestined
  let me fail not in helping those in need
  let me do good.

Oh but everything I do is infected with sin
  I see it because I know it in my heart
  
When I am helpful
  I do so in order for people to like me

When I am nice
  I want people to think I am good
  but if they could see my heart
  if they could see the thoughts of my mind
  they would run continuously
  they judge me wanting.

But you saw the depths of my soul
  even beyond what I can see
  in the darkness and despair
  you did not shudder 
  you did not look away
  you took pity on this old fool
  you gave me your Son
  you gave me your Spirit
  you gave me your inheritance
  your daily mercies
  your sweetest grace 
  your steadfast love
  forever.

Keep me in palms of your hands
  O Lord
  I stand on the spoken word of your Son
  that no one
  not anything
  Satan
  death
  demons
  hell
  can take me from your hands
  I know
  you will never let me go.

Keep me in your heart
  speak into my soul
  write your words in my heart
  that I may never sin against you.
```
