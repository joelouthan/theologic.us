## The Psalm

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Strength
</div>

```text
I will never forget
  my deepest sins
  my anguish
  my torment
  my chaos
  my own iniquity

And you were so far
  I thought I knew you
  and I could not see your face
  All that appeared to me
  was darkness
  and dread
  and death
  and disease
  and wickedness.

I did not knew you well enough
  because your hand was always on my soul
  your grace always surrounded me
  your righteousness always clothed me
  your peace was placed in my heart.

My response
  to your goodness
  was the worst.
  But when I was faithless
  you are were absolutely faithful
  and just to forgive my sin
  and cleansed me of my sin
  over and over.

You will never tire 
  of rescuing me
  I need your help
  always I need you
  be my God
  and my Lord forever.

Amen.
```
