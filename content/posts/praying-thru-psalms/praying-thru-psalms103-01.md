So what then can I say?  
So what then can I do?  
All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,  
I thank you for giving me strength.

Thank you my Father God.  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.  

You judged me faithful.  
You appointed to Your service.  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,  
Your holy name,  
despite my persecution and hatred  
those who love you,  
despite my perverted and violent opposition  
towards you,  

Still  
I only received mercy  
because I was lost  
I was lame  
I was deaf  
I was blind  
I was stupid  
I was ignorant  
I was evil  
I was dead  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender  
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for me  
overwhelmingly  
undeservedly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,  
for You,  
through You,  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.  

These words  
out of my heart  
are true  
and with all of my hope and dreams  
and desires and wishes  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.  

I know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue your people  
to pull them out of despair  
to give your people life  
to save them from their sins  
to bring them to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And I lead this group.  
I am the foremost  
I am their chief  
I am their victor  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  

Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
my Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display  

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those who You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  

This is why I will sing  
to my God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
my Triune  
my Father  
my Son  
my Holy Spirit  
my immortal  
my invisible  
my Only One  
my Creator  
my Sustainer  
my Merciful  
my Peace  
my Grace  
my Faith  
my Messiah  
my Immanuel, God with Us  
my Blessed  
my Living Word  
my Christ  
my Son of God  
my Fellow Heir  
my Second Adam  
my Kinsman Redeemer  
my Beginning  
my Means  
my End  
my Majesty  
my Truth  
my Way  
my Life  
my Wisdom  
my Teacher  
my Rescuer  
my Promise  
my Calling  
my Fulfillment  
my Abundance  
my Host  
my Governor  
my High Priest  
my Prophet  
my Apostle  
my Sufferer  
my Messiah  
my Servant  
my Son of Man  
my Glorified  
my Power  
my Gospel  
my Guide  
my Elector  
my All-Sufficient  
my Lion of Judah  
my Worthy Lamb who was slain  
my King of all kings  
my Lord of all lords  
my Commander  
my Ruler above all  
my Name above all Names  
my Wonderful Counselor  
my Mighty God  
my Everlasting Father  
my Prince of Peace  

my Holiness  
my Righteousness  
my Justice  
my Faithfulness  
my Mercy  
my Grace  
my Friend  
my Confidence  
my Pastor  
my Elder  
my Brother  
my Assurance  
my Redeemer  
my Rock  
my Salvation  
my All in all  
my Exalted  
my Glorious  
my Beloved  
my Joy  
my Song  
my Love  

my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.  

So I will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,  
and love  
You alone.  

I pray this desperately and joyfully,  
in the beautiful,  
sweet,  
precious,  
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  

His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

And with every bit of my soul
body
strength
mind
heart

I will praise and bless your holy name
forever

Amen.
