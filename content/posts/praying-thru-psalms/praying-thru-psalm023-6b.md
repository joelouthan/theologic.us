## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
O Lord,
</div>

```text
Tender mercies,
  you have given me
  every single day that I life.
I was so far from you
  from your will 
  and your flock
  and your heart.

But I was never more
  than a mere breath away
    from your mercies for me.

Even in my wickedness,
  your kindness towards me
  was your continuous call
  for me to come home to you.

My God,
  Keep me close to your heart
  and do not let me stray.
  What little I know of my heart,
  I know it wants to flee from you.

You, my God,
  keep your children close.
  Never let me go.
  Do what you must
  so I can spend all of my days
  with you.

I love you, Lord.
  and I lift my voice
  to worship you.
  Forevermore.
```
