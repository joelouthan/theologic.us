## The Psalms

>Psalm 95 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>Come, let’s shout joyfully to the LORD, shout triumphantly to the rock of our salvation! 

><sup> 2  </sup>Let’s enter his presence with thanksgiving; let’s shout triumphantly to him in song. 

><sup> 3  </sup>For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods. 

><sup> 4  </sup>The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks are his. 

><sup> 5  </sup>The sea is his; he made it. His hands formed the dry land. 

><sup> 6  </sup>Come, let’s worship and bow down; let’s kneel before the LORD our Maker. 

><sup> 7  </sup>For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep under his care. Today, if you hear his voice: 

><sup> 8  </sup>Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, as on that day at Massah in the wilderness 

><sup> 9  </sup>where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did. 

><sup> 10  </sup>For forty years I was disgusted with that generation; I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray; they do not know my ways.” 

><sup> 11  </sup>So I swore in my anger, “They will not enter my rest.”
