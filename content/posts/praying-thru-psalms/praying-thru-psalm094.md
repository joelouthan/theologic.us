## The Psalms

>Psalm 94 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>LORD, God of vengeance— God of vengeance, shine! 

><sup> 2  </sup>Rise up, Judge of the earth; repay the proud what they deserve. 

><sup> 3  </sup>LORD, how long will the wicked— how long will the wicked celebrate? 

><sup> 4  </sup>They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. 

><sup> 5  </sup>LORD, they crush your people; they oppress your heritage. 

><sup> 6  </sup>They kill the widow and the resident alien and murder the fatherless. 

><sup> 7  </sup>They say, “The LORD doesn’t see it. The God of Jacob doesn’t pay attention.” 

><sup> 8  </sup>Pay attention, you stupid people! Fools, when will you be wise? 

><sup> 9  </sup>Can the one who shaped the ear not hear, the one who formed the eye not see? 

><sup> 10  </sup>The one who instructs nations, the one who teaches mankind knowledge— does he not discipline? 

><sup> 11  </sup>The LORD knows the thoughts of mankind; they are futile. 

><sup> 12  </sup>LORD, how happy is anyone you discipline and teach from your law 

><sup> 13  </sup>to give him relief from troubled times until a pit is dug for the wicked. 

><sup> 14  </sup>The LORD will not leave his people or abandon his heritage, 

><sup> 15  </sup>for the administration of justice will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 

><sup> 16  </sup>Who stands up for me against the wicked? Who takes a stand for me against evildoers? 

><sup> 17  </sup>If the LORD had not been my helper, I would soon rest in the silence of death. 

><sup> 18  </sup>If I say, “My foot is slipping,” your faithful love will support me, LORD. 

><sup> 19  </sup>When I am filled with cares, your comfort brings me joy. 

><sup> 20  </sup>Can a corrupt throne be your ally, a throne that makes evil laws? 

><sup> 21  </sup>They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 

><sup> 22  </sup>But the LORD is my refuge; my God is the rock of my protection. 

><sup> 23  </sup>He will pay them back for their sins and destroy them for their evil. The LORD our God will destroy them.

```text
The sins against me
  when the people should have
  cared for me
  tender towards me
  love me
  cherish me

Instead
  I was forgotten
  forsaken
  betrayed
  hated
  unloved

But you appeared
  you saved me
  and nothing I have done
  brought you to me
  everything that I have done
  should have attracted your wrath

Those who forgotten me
  you are closer than whisper
  those who forsaken me
  you dwell in me
  those who have betrayed me
  you have adopted me
  those who have hated me 
  you have loved me
  those who despite me
  I am my Beloved
  and you are mine
  forever 
```
