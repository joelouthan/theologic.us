## The Psalm

>Psalm 37 (CSB)  
><sup>7</sup> Be silent before the LORD and wait expectantly for him; do not be agitated by one who prospers in his way, by the person who carries out evil plans. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My One Rock
</div>

```text
I examine my life
  filled with despair
  chaos
  confusion
  darkness
  death.

And your love
  have pierced through it all
  into my heart
  and gave me life
  when I was dead
  joy
  when there was sorrow
  pleasure
  when all I have ever known is pain
  weakness
  when I have tried to be strong
  humility
  when I was filled with pride
  righteousness
  when the world excused my lusts
  holiness
  when I was sin.

Be my Rock of Ages
  Be my source
  Be the water to my thirst
  nourishment to my hunger
  satisfaction to my emptiness
  peace to my soul.

I love you Lord
  now and always

Amen.
```
