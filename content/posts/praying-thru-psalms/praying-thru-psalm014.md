  O Lord,
</div>

```text
I would say to you, “I have not forgotten you.” But what about those times I succumb to the wickedness of my heart, to the depravity of the world, or to the lies of Satan? What about those times?

What about those times when I am devoid of strength and I do not turn to the one who has my infinite strength?

What about those times when I rely on my rational thought process, the very good gift that you have given me, instead being depended and led by that very Giver, the Spirit of God, by which I am declared to be your beloved son?

What if I want to do good things that seem to glorify you but in deepest heart, only meagerly fulfill my desire for worship when it is you, O Lord, who has set eternity into my heart so that I would be left desolated when I tried to fulfill that hole with anything else other than the Infinite God?

But you know me. You have known me before you created time. You have known me and in your knowledge of all my pain, my heartaches, my troubles, my sin, my depravity, my iniquities, _you loved me_. You loved me with all of your infinite being. You loved me and you created me. You take joy in me, you watch over me, and you sing over me.
One day, you will come and get me so I can be with you for all of eternity.

And you have sent your Son to live when I could not live, to die when I should have died, to be buried when my sins would have soon crushed me, and to be raised to life because I have none.

And you have given me your Spirit to give me strength because I am so mortal; to give me hope when there is none in this life that is hopeful; to be conformed to look like your Son so that you can _logically, reasonably, and justly_ declare me to be your own; and to give me not just life but the fullness of life.

You have spoken to me. You called out to me. You have said these things and so many more things so that my joy may be full,

For your great glory forevermore.

God, thank you. Thank you for loving me.

I love you.

In your Son’s awesome name, I pray this.
Amen.
```
