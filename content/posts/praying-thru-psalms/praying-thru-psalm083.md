## The Psalms

>Psalm 83 (CSB)  
> A song. A psalm of Asaph. 

><sup> 1 </sup> God, do not keep silent. Do not be deaf, God; do not be quiet. 

><sup> 2 </sup> See how your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have acted arrogantly. 

><sup> 3 </sup> They devise clever schemes against your people; they conspire against your treasured ones. 

><sup> 4 </sup> They say, “Come, lets wipe them out as a nation so that Israel’s name will no longer be remembered.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> For they have conspired with one mind; they form an alliance against you— 

><sup> 6 </sup> the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 

><sup> 7 </sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Even Assyria has joined them; they lend support to the sons of Lot. Selah 

><sup> 9 </sup> Deal with them as you did with Midian, as you did with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River. 

><sup> 10 </sup> They were destroyed at En-dor; they became manure for the ground. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

><sup> 12 </sup> who said, “Lets seize God’s pastures for ourselves.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like straw before the wind. 

><sup> 14 </sup> As fire burns a forest, as a flame blazes through mountains, 

><sup> 15 </sup> so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Cover their faces with shame so that they will seek your name, LORD. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Let them be put to shame and terrified forever; let them perish in disgrace. 

><sup> 18 </sup> May they know that you alone— whose name is the LORD— are the Most High over the whole earth.
