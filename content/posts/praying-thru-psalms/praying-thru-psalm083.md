## The Psalm

>Psalm 83 (CSB)  
> A song. A psalm of Asaph. 

><sup> 1 </sup> God, do not keep silent. Do not be deaf, God; do not be quiet. 

><sup> 2 </sup> See how your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have acted arrogantly. 

><sup> 3 </sup> They devise clever schemes against your people; they conspire against your treasured ones. 

><sup> 4 </sup> They say, “Come, lets wipe them out as a nation so that Israel’s name will no longer be remembered.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> For they have conspired with one mind; they form an alliance against you— 

><sup> 6 </sup> the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 

><sup> 7 </sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre. 

><sup> 8 </sup> Even Assyria has joined them; they lend support to the sons of Lot. Selah 

><sup> 9 </sup> Deal with them as you did with Midian, as you did with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River. 

><sup> 10 </sup> They were destroyed at En-dor; they became manure for the ground. 

><sup> 11 </sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

><sup> 12 </sup> who said, “Lets seize God’s pastures for ourselves.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like straw before the wind. 

><sup> 14 </sup> As fire burns a forest, as a flame blazes through mountains, 

><sup> 15 </sup> so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Cover their faces with shame so that they will seek your name, LORD. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Let them be put to shame and terrified forever; let them perish in disgrace. 

><sup> 18 </sup> May they know that you alone— whose name is the LORD— are the Most High over the whole earth.

```text
Whatever life and death and grief and sadness and sin
  presses down my life
  grinds my bone into dust
  breaks my heart into a billion pieces
  and drags my soul into hell

You are my God
  and my Lord
  and my King
  and my Great Love.

And you have not forgotten me
  no forsaken me
  you have loved me since forever
  and you will love me forever
  You have always preserved my life
  and you have given me real hope
  in my hour of desperate need.

Because of what you have done
  because of your work on your cross
  you saved me
  moreso, you conquered my true enemies
  sin
  Satan
  demons
  hell
  death.

I don't to have to hate anyone who does me harm
  I pray that you would save them to the utmost
  and that they will know your great love for them
  for all of their days.

You are my Great Conqueror
  and your conquest is finish.
  Allow me to herald your great gospel
  "Repent, for the kingdom of God is here!"

Amen
