## The Psalm

>Psalm 82 (CSB)  
> A psalm of Asaph. 

><sup> 1 </sup> God stands in the divine assembly; he pronounces judgment among the gods: 

><sup> 2 </sup> “How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 

><sup> 3 </sup> Provide justice for the needy and the fatherless; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Rescue the poor and needy; save them from the power of the wicked.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> They do not know or understand; they wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 

><sup> 6 </sup> I said, “You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High. 

><sup> 7 </sup> However, you will die like humans and fall like any other ruler.” 

><sup> 8 </sup> Rise up, God, judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Rightly and Only Divine
</div>

```text
You, O Lord, are high
  above all the earth
  you are exalted
  far above all other gods.

All of the idols that I have worshiped for all of my life
  I place them into your presence
  so you will break their hands
  and snap their necks
  and sever their heads
  to kill them all off.

Moreso, I repent of all the times
  I was a god
  that I made it about me
  and my needs and desires.
  Without your gracious and soft heart
  without your Spirit dwelling in me
  without your Christ that came and rescue me
  I would die and fall like any other idol.

I love you, Lord, and all that is in me
  I will bless your holy name forever.

Amen
```
