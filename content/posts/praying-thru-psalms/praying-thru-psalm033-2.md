## The Psalm



## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
The Absolute of All His Promises,
</div>

```text
I remember when you fulfilled your word
  in the gospel to Adam and Eve
  in the promise to Noah and his family
  in the covenant to Abraham
  in your example with Saul
  in your steadfastness to David
  in your wisdom with Soloman
  in your keep with Isaiah
  in your tower with Jeremiah
  in your instructions with Hosea
  in your mystery with Daniel
  in your glory with Ezekiel
  in your ending with Malachi

That you alone would
  send a Savior
  bring a Messiah
  to crush the enemy
  to keep your justice sure
  out of a family
  upon the throne
  to rescue His beloved
  to save His people from their sins
  to adopted into your family
  to be redeemed of their past
  to be resurrected to glory
  to never perish
  to never see corruption
  to never see hell
  to the fullness of life
  to the presence of unending joy
  to pleasures forevermore

That is Jesus Christ
  the fulfiller of the law
  the keeper of the promises
  the worthy lamb that was slain
  the absorber of wrath
  the burden of my sin
  the bearer of my sorrows
  the welcomer of my trespasses
  the seed of Abraham
  the righteousness of me
  the lover of my soul
  the love of my heart

I am my Beloved
and he is mine forever.

Amen.
```
