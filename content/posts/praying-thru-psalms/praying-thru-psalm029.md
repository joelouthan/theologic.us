## The Psalm

>Psalm 29 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 

><sup>2</sup> Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness. 

><sup>3</sup> The voice of the LORD is above the waters. The God of glory thunders— the LORD, above the vast water, 

><sup>4</sup> the voice of the LORD in power, the voice of the LORD in splendor. 

><sup>5</sup> The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 

><sup>6</sup> He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion, like a young wild ox. 

><sup>7</sup> The voice of the LORD flashes flames of fire. 

><sup>8</sup> The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 

><sup>9</sup> The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the woodlands bare. In his temple all cry, “Glory!” 

><sup>10</sup> The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned, King forever. 

><sup>11</sup> The LORD gives his people strength; the LORD blesses his people with peace.

## The Prayer

```text
Who is like you,
    splendid in majesty
    high and exalted
    wonderful and amazing
    beautiful and all-together lovely.

So I will sing this song,
    with all of my days
    because you are my portion
    and you loved me since forever.

How many times have you rescued me
    from the pit of despair
    from the darkness of hell
    from the knife edge of death?

I know not the countless times.

But you are faithful in all of your ways,
    perfect
    true
    blessed
    good
    righteous

And I know you will rescue me countless times more.

I praise you forever I will praise you.

Forever I will sing
    you are my beauty
    you are my strength

And I will sing.
```
