## The Psalm

>Psalm 24 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 

><sup>1</sup> The earth and everything in it, the world and its inhabitants, belong to the LORD; 

><sup>2</sup> for he laid its foundation on the seas and established it on the rivers. 

><sup>3</sup> Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place? 

><sup>4</sup> The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not appealed to what is false, and who has not sworn deceitfully. 

><sup>5</sup> He will receive blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

><sup>6</sup> Such is the generation of those who inquire of him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah 

><sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates! Rise up, ancient doors! Then the King of glory will come in. 

><sup>8</sup> Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle. 

><sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates! Rise up, ancient doors! Then the King of glory will come in. 

><sup>10</sup> Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD of Armies, he is the King of glory. Selah

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Ascended God</div>

```text
All of Creation is yours.
  It belongs to you,
  And you rule overall.

Yet, despite my own wickedness,
  and corruption
  you sought me.
  You would even descend to become man.
  So that in you,
  you would be my righteousness.

You are the Worthy Lamb who was slain.
  Only you, my Lord, can open the gates of heaven.
  Only you, Jesus, can set the captives free.
  Only you, my Redeemer, saved a sinner like me.

I will worship you alone
  for salvation belongs to you alone
  for you are the mighty one who saves.

Who are you, my Lord?
  You are the King of glory
  Forevermore.

Amen.
```
