The Sovereign Power over my life
</div>

```text
My God,
  if I was raped
  tortured
  bruised
  afflicted
  pressed
  crushed
  beaten
  sicken
  destroyed
  attacked
  for all of my days
  If I faced unspeakable
  evil acts against me

I will call upon you
  to give me your Son
  to give me your Spirit
  to raise my lowly head
  to open my eyes
  to see your lovely face
  once more
  to take me home

My life before you
  was everything evil
  was none of it good
  it was torturous
  crushing
  back-breaking
  afflicting
  because of the sheer weight
  of all of my sins.

The evil I have done
  was enough to try to take my life
  and surely I was not good
  surely I would have perish
  and be under the wrath of your Son
  forever.

For I was once foolish,
  disobedient,
  led astray,
  slaves to various passions and pleasures,
  passing my days in malice and envy,
  hated by others
  and hating everybody.

But when
  the goodness and
  loving kindness of
  God my Savior appeared,
  you saved me.

Not because of any works I have done in righteousness,
  because everything that I have ever done
  are stench of death to your nostrils.

But why?
  According to your own mercy,
  by the washing me in regeneration and
  renewal of the Holy Spirit,
  whom you have poured out on me
  richly through Jesus Christ my Savior,
  so that I am justified by his grace
  and I might become an heir
  according to the hope of eternal life.

Praise your lovely name on high.
```
