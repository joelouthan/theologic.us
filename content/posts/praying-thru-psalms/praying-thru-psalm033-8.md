## The Psalm

>Psalm 33:8 (CSB) Let the whole earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Fear and my Joy
</div>

```text
I sit
  and make no excuses
  for my sin blinds me
  my wickedness keeps me deaf
  my trespasses rob my smarts
  my treason born death in me.

I could not see your glory
  I was blind and cannot see
  and not thing in me
  could process your beauty.

I had no frame
  no knowledge
  no heart
  no love
  no life.

Therefore I did not fear you.

When I did see your glory,
  I fell in awe
  I lay prostrate in terror
  my face down because I fear
  I saw my own sin
  compare to your holiness
  and surely I would perish
  because you are too good.

But you reached down
  gave me life
  strength to my legs
  beat to my heart
  picked me up like a child
  held me close to your heart
  and whispered these words,

"I do not condemn you
  and I love you.
  You never have to sin again
  for you are mine
  and I am yours forever.'

Praise your sweet name.
```
