Worthy is Your Grace
</div>

```text
I will never stop
  writing words
  sing songs
  mulling thoughts
  sleeping in my dreams
  reading books
  dwelling in your word
  filled with your Spirit
  to try do my best
  to express the grace
  that you have drowned me in
  lavished upon my life
  that is more than all the riches in the world
  more than the deepest minds
  the greatest wisdom
  all the love
  all of everything.

Your grace
  is more than my pain
  my despair
  my deceit
  my hurts
  my wounds
  my brokenness
  my trauma
  the sin committed against me
  the sin I have committed against others
  all the evil in this world.

Your grace
  was fulfilled
  perfect
  complete
  totality
  definite
  found in your Son
  Jesus Christ.

Now I am saved

Now I am yours

Now you are mine

Your presence is forever with me
  and I am forever in your grasp
  No one can ever remove me
  nothing can ever separate us
  nothing can come between us.

Your grace
  is worth more
  than anything I ever had in this world
  and the best of anything I have ever lost.

You found me
  and now I have everything
  because I have you
  You are my heart and my love and joy forever.

Amen.
```
