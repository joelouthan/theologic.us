## The Psalms

>Psalm 91 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. 

><sup> 2  </sup>I will say concerning the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust: 

><sup> 3  </sup>He himself will rescue you from the bird trap, from the destructive plague. 

><sup> 4  </sup>He will cover you with his feathers; you will take refuge under his wings. His faithfulness will be a protective shield. 

><sup> 5  </sup>You will not fear the terror of the night, the arrow that flies by day, 

><sup> 6  </sup>the plague that stalks in darkness, or the pestilence that ravages at noon. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Though a thousand fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, the pestilence will not reach you. 

><sup> 8  </sup>You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked. 

><sup> 9  </sup>Because you have made the LORD—my refuge, the Most High—your dwelling place, 

><sup> 10  </sup>no harm will come to you; no plague will come near your tent. 

><sup> 11  </sup>For he will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways. 

><sup> 12  </sup>They will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 

><sup> 13  </sup>You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the young lion and the serpent. 

><sup> 14  </sup>Because he has his heart set on me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he knows my name. 

><sup> 15  </sup>When he calls out to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will rescue him and give him honor. 

><sup> 16  </sup>I will satisfy him with a long life and show him my salvation.

I remember all the times when my Grandma would pray this prayer over me. When she did, I never knew why.

But the dangers and the turmoil and the devastation I would face,
  when Satan and his demons would place their hands on me
  and do me much harm.

When the world and its effects
  finally succeeded in corrupting my soul
  and had me worshipping demons.

When the wickedness of my heart
  turned against you
  and I gave into my whims and desires
  and received only shit.

Still,
  these prayers and the faith my grandma
  protest my heart, my soul, my heart, and my life.

You did not ignore nor discard me
  you saved me.

You did not leave me to rot and die
  you gave me life.

You did not left me lonely, hated, and at war with you
  you were always my God.

Be exalted, O Lord
  be exalted, higher and higher
  and I will forever praise your holy name.

Amen
