## The Psalms

>Psalm 91 (CSB)  
><sup> 1  </sup>The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. 

><sup> 2  </sup>I will say concerning the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust: 

><sup> 3  </sup>He himself will rescue you from the bird trap, from the destructive plague. 

><sup> 4  </sup>He will cover you with his feathers; you will take refuge under his wings. His faithfulness will be a protective shield. 

><sup> 5  </sup>You will not fear the terror of the night, the arrow that flies by day, 

><sup> 6  </sup>the plague that stalks in darkness, or the pestilence that ravages at noon. 

><sup> 7  </sup>Though a thousand fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, the pestilence will not reach you. 

><sup> 8  </sup>You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked. 

><sup> 9  </sup>Because you have made the LORD—my refuge, the Most High—your dwelling place, 

><sup> 10  </sup>no harm will come to you; no plague will come near your tent. 

><sup> 11  </sup>For he will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways. 

><sup> 12  </sup>They will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 

><sup> 13  </sup>You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the young lion and the serpent. 

><sup> 14  </sup>Because he has his heart set on me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he knows my name. 

><sup> 15  </sup>When he calls out to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will rescue him and give him honor. 

><sup> 16  </sup>I will satisfy him with a long life and show him my salvation.
