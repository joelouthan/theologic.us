## The Psalm

>Psalm 103 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 

><sup>1</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 

><sup>2</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and do not forget all his benefits. 

><sup>3</sup> He forgives all your iniquity; he heals all your diseases. 

><sup>4</sup> He redeems your life from the Pit; he crowns you with faithful love and compassion. 

><sup>5</sup> He satisfies you with good things; your youth is renewed like the eagle. 

><sup>6</sup> The LORD executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. 

><sup>7</sup> He revealed his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel. 

><sup>8</sup> The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love. 

><sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse us or be angry forever. 

><sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our iniquities. 

><sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his faithful love toward those who fear him. 

><sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 

><sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him. 

><sup>14</sup> For he knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust. 

><sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass— he blooms like a flower of the field; 

><sup>16</sup> when the wind passes over it, it vanishes, and its place is no longer known. 

><sup>17</sup> But from eternity to eternity the LORD’s faithful love is toward those who fear him, and his righteousness toward the grandchildren 

><sup>18</sup> of those who keep his covenant, who remember to observe his precepts. 

><sup>19</sup> The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. 

><sup>20</sup> Bless the LORD, all his angels of great strength, who do his word, obedient to his command. 

><sup>21</sup> Bless the LORD, all his armies, his servants who do his will. 

><sup>22</sup> Bless the LORD, all his works in all the places where he rules. My soul, bless the LORD!
