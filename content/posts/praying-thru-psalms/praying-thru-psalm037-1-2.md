```text
What is our lives, O Lord
  that we would be counted as precious
  that you would be mindful of us
  that you would set your affections upon us
  that you would give your grace to us
  and you would want to cherish us?

But Lord,
  we are here for a moment
  our lives are but a blink
  your word says,
  like dew on grass
  until the early morning sun
  scorches the fields
  and burns us all away.

Lord,
  keep my mind on these things
  that what I might do here
  will give you eternal glory.

Let wait upon your words
  so I might only prophesy
  and build up your church.

Let my hands and feet
  run after
  those in need
  and serve according to your will.

Let me only herald
  the eternal kingdom
  of the Son of David
  and evangelize till the end of the earth
  "The Kingdom of God is here!"

Help me not waste one second of my life
  but give you eternal glory.

I pray this in your Son's precious and holy name forever.

Amen.
```
