## The Psalm

>Psalm 11 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. Of David. 

><sup>1</sup> I have taken refuge in the LORD. How can you say to me, “Escape to the mountains like a bird! 

><sup>2</sup> For look, the wicked string bows; they put their arrows on bowstrings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 

><sup>3</sup> When the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?” 

><sup>4</sup> The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD—his throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his gaze examines everyone. 

><sup>5</sup> The LORD examines the righteous, but he hates the wicked and those who love violence. 

><sup>6</sup> Let him rain burning coals and sulfur on the wicked; let a scorching wind be the portion in their cup. 

><sup>7</sup> For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds. The upright will see his face.

## The Prayer

  Dear God,

I have seen the volley of artillery rain down all around me and You, O Lord, my precious shield, have absorbed their attacks. Yet, the enemy’s sharpshooters have taken careful aim at my heart. Their fiery bullets have pierced my chest. Their lies have penetrated my mind. Their blasphemous words have laid weight upon my soul.

It hurts me so.

But You, O God, are endlessly faithful:

  Faithful to save.

  Faithful to heal.

  Faithful to restore.

  Faithful to equip.

  Faithful to send.

My Commander of Hosts, help me in my moment of despair.
  My feet, which are strapped with Your gospel of peace,
  have been firmly planted into the Rock of Ages.
  I will and cannot retreat. I shall not be moved.

You see, your victory is complete.

Your finished work continues to grow in ranks by the indwelling of your Holy Spirit,
  the swelling of our hearts and the changing of our minds.
  
Your kingdom presses against the gates of hell.

I can now hear the rivets popping from the weight of your awesome glory.

May I continue to herald your great works and your great name for the rest of my days.

In your name, I pray.

Amen.
```
