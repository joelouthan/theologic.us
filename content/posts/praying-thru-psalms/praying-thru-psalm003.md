## The Psalm

>Psalm 3 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David when he fled from his son Absalom. 

><sup>1</sup> LORD, how my foes increase! There are many who attack me. 

><sup>2</sup> Many say about me, “There is no help for him in God.” Selah 

><sup>3</sup> But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 

><sup>4</sup> I cry aloud to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy mountain. Selah 

><sup>5</sup> I lie down and sleep; I wake again because the LORD sustains me. 

><sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of thousands of people who have taken their stand against me on every side. 

><sup>7</sup> Rise up, LORD! Save me, my God! You strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 

><sup>8</sup> Salvation belongs to the LORD; may your blessing be on your people. Selah

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My God,
</div>

```text
In my finite perception, my circumstances would seem to say I am in despair. I feel that. I feel that onslaught. I feel that pressure.
Many would say, ”Ah, your God has failed. Your God is not good. Your God does not deliver. Your God does not save.”

They would be wrong on all accounts.

When I turn away from all of my oppressors and turn towards you, I see the loveliness of your face. It is because of your presence, my soul is now at rest.

Your Son took all of my affliction and wrath and absorbed all the violence that can ever be dealt to me. I will see no punishment from you. I will see no anger from you. I will see no rejection from you. You will not forsake me. You will not forget me.

Salvation belongs to you, O Lord, for you are the mighty one to save.

Be with me, Lord. I have no one else to turn to. You alone have the words to eternal life.
By Your Son's beautiful name,

Amen
```
