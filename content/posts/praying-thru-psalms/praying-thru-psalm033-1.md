## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Only One Worthy of all my praises
</div>

```text
Who was the only one
  who created the heavens
  from a thought
  who created the earth
  from a whisper?

Who was the only one
  from deep love
  and passionate affections
  for a desire
  to create a perfect relationship
  with a creation
  out of a perfect community?

Who was the only one
  who preached his perfect standard
  who grieved when we rebelled
  who filled with sorrow
    when we wage war against you
  who cried when we turned away from you?

Who was the only one
  who never flinched at our wickedness
  who never balked at our sinfulness
  who never backed away from our evilness
  who ALONE who stared death
    through his skull
    and with the loudest voice
    and the deepest wells of tears
    the same tongue who spoke
    all creation into existence
    cries out
    COME TO LIFE!

Who resurrected my dead heart?

Who was like that?

No one.

No one could nor willing nor had the power.

You alone.

You alone are God.

You alone are good forever.

Amen.

```
