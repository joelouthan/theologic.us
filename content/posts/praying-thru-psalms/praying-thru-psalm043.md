## The Psalm

>Psalm 43 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and champion my cause against an unfaithful nation; rescue me from the deceitful and unjust person. 

><sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my refuge. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression? 

><sup>3</sup> Send your light and your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain, to your dwelling place. 

><sup>4</sup> Then I will come to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise you with the lyre, God, my God. 

><sup>5</sup> Why, my soul, are you so dejected? Why are you in such turmoil? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him, my Savior and my God.

When will I know
  when those who would cause me harm
  have hurt me
  betrayed me
  abandoned me
  and discard me
  that I am sorrowful for that hurt
  and I grieve
  and I am angry for what was done
  because I have been hurt

But for most of my life
  I have let that fester into
  rage
  vengeance
  and wrath

It has taken me all of my life
  to know
  that rage is a sin
  vengeance belongs to you, O Lord
  and you alone are deserving of wrath

But here is the key
  in you great love
  you sent your Son
  so that for your people
  for the salvation of those you have elected
  you pour your wrath
  not on us
  but on your Son
  because he is the Worthy Lamb that was slain
  holy holy holy is he

Cleansed my heart
  of my wickedness
  in thinking I am God
  I am not Never will I be you

Save us
  and keep us in your mercy
  shower us with grace
  and give us your steadfast love
  for all of our days

I love you Lord
  thank you for saving me

Save those whom I know and care for and love

Amen
```
