## The Psalm

>Psalm 31:6â€“8 (CSB)  
><sup>6</sup> I hate those who are devoted to worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD. 

><sup>7</sup> I will rejoice and be glad in your faithful love because you have seen my affliction. You know the troubles of my soul 

><sup>8</sup> and have not handed me over to the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lover of my soul</div>

```text
I cry and grieve for those 
  who do not know you. 
  I pray that their hearts
  would be turned towards you. 

You have rescued me countless times. 
  And all I have ever found
  was your loving grace. 

Lord, you did not abandon me
  Not to hell
  Not to sin
  Not to this world
  Not to Satan
  Not to demons 
  Not to death

You rescued me
  with your compassion. 
  You restored my soul
  for the sake of your Son. 
  You gave me life
  by the power of your Spirit.
I will love you
  for all of my days. 

```
