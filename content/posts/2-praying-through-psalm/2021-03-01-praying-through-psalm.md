```text> Psalm 54 (CSB) For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. When the Ziphites went and said to Saul, “Is David not hiding among us?”
      God, save me by your name, 
      and vindicate me by your might! 
      God, hear my prayer; 
      listen to the words from my mouth. 
      For strangers rise up against me, 
      and violent men intend to kill me. 
      They do not let God guide them. 
                                      Selah
      God is my helper; 
      the Lord is the sustainer of my life. 
      He will repay my adversaries for their evil. 
      Because of your faithfulness, annihilate them.
      I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you. 
      I will praise your name, LORD, 
      because it is good. 
      For he has rescued me from every trouble, 
      and my eye has looked down on my enemies.
