<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My God
</div>
 
```text
I cannot fall back into wickedness
I cannot sin again
I cannot be apart from you
I cannot

I don't want to live
If I cannot be in your presence
You life is my life
And I choose not to live without you.

Any sin left on my heart
I need you wash it away
Bring it up
Give me the gift of repentance
So I can turn away
And turn to you.

Do this every moment of my life
I have done everything
The world
My friends
Work
Satan
Demons
And sin
Told me to go after
And all of it is crap
I find it wanting
It is lacking

You have been the only thing
That I have ever experienced
That has given me perfection
Perfect in love
Grace
mercy

You are better
You are more
You are righteous
You are far above all of my gods.

I hate this world
And I want nothing from it.

Take me home.
Cleansed me of sin
And take me home
You are so good
And there is nothing left here for me.

Amen.
