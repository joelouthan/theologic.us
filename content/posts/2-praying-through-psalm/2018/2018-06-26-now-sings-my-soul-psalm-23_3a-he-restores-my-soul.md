<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
My Lord,
</div>

```text
I perish without you.

I cannot live without you.

Apart from you, the hole in my inner being remained infinitely empty.

Without you, I strived
  and pushed
  and pulled
  and made idols
  and did whatever I need to do in order to fill my soul.

But all of it comes up empty.

But you, O Lord, not only fills my heart to the brim but gives my soul b
  and new life.

Now, I run after you.

Now I walk with you.

Now you are with me
  and I am with you forever.

Lord, give me the fullness of your Spirit so I might walk in your statues
  and obey your commands.

More than that, that I would have the strength to do you what you have called me to do.

For my joy
  and your glory.

Forevermore.

I love you.
```
