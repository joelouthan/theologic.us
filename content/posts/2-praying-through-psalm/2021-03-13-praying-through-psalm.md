Psalms 66 (CSB) Let the whole earth shout joyfully to God!
Sing about the glory of his name;
make his praise glorious.
Say to God, “How awe-inspiring are your works!
Your enemies will cringe before you
because of your great strength.
The whole earth will worship you
and sing praise to you.
They will sing praise to your name.”Selah
Come and see the wonders of God;
his acts for humanity are awe-inspiring.
He turned the sea into dry land,
and they crossed the river on foot.
There we rejoiced in him.
He rules forever by his might;
he keeps his eye on the nations.
The rebellious should not exalt themselves.Selah
Bless our God, you peoples;
let the sound of his praise be heard.
He keeps us alive
and does not allow our feet to slip.
For you, God, tested us;
you refined us as silver is refined.
You lured us into a trap;
you placed burdens on our backs.
You let men ride over our heads;
we went through fire and water,
but you brought us out to abundance.
I will enter your house with burnt offerings;
I will pay you my vows
that my lips promised
and my mouth spoke during my distress.
I will offer you fattened sheep as burnt offerings,
with the fragrant smoke of rams;
I will sacrifice bulls with goats.Selah
Come and listen, all who fear God,
and I will tell what he has done for me.
I cried out to him with my mouth,
and praise was on my tongue.
If I had been aware of malice in my heart,
the Lord would not have listened.
However, God has listened;
he has paid attention to the sound of my prayer.
Blessed be God!
He has not turned away my prayer
or turned his faithful love from me.
