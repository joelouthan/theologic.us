```text
People of God,
  inhabitants of the world
  dwellers in the city

Turn your eyes upon God
  look at his amazing love
  His grace is for you!

You do not have to die in your sin
  He will rescue you!
  He will pull you from hell

You say, "I have no sin"
  then you are condemned already
  but those in Christ
  there is no condemnation

You say, "There is no hell"
  but to those who do not
  trust and obey the Son
  the wrath of God remains upon you!
  But if you believe and obey
  the Lamb who was slain
  he takes the wrath
  that was properly owed to you.

You say, "There is no God"
  Do not be a hypocrite
  Do not suppress
  what you have seen
  what you have experience
  what you know 
  about God.
  Go back into the only
  good
  perfect
  blameless
  word
  where He speaks about who He is
  who His Son is
  and what His Spirit will do.

I pray
  that you worship God 
  with me
  that you love God
  with all of your heart
  that you pray to God
  and ask to be delivered

Your circumstances might not change
  your sins might catch up
  you will still be affected by other's sins
  But God will always be there
  He will mark you as holy
  because he is holy
  He will count you as righteous
  because his Son took on your sin
  He will call you His beloved child
  because the Spirit shall bear witness.

Worship God!
  He alone is worthy.
```
