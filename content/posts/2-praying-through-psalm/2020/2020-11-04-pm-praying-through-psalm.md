My Eternal Righteousness
</div>

```text
I have spent a lifetime
  ignoring this precious truth
  that you loved the world so much
  that you sent your only begotten Son
  to live and die for his people
  to rise again to champion over
  death
  hell
  Satan
  demons
  sin.

For those who want to live with you forever
  we would only need to believe in you
  trust in you
  obey your word
  and take you at your word.

The earth if full of the steadfast love of the Lord
  because You have sent your Son to us

You love righteousness
  because You have sent your Son to us

You love justice
  because You have sent your Son speedily to us

Lord,
  help me
  to never cease wondering at who you are
  to never wander from your right hand
  to never look away from your beautiful face
  deliver me
  to keep me with you
  to lay my head upon your heart
  to rest in your arms
  and keep from sin
  all the days of my life

Amen

```
