```text
My Lord,
  if it be your will
  and under your grace alone,
  allow me your humble servant
  and your little child
  to preach your good news to the whole world.

You are my Love and my Heart,
  there is none like you.
  You are Savior of the world,
  there is none like you.
  You are more beautiful,
  and the fairest of 10,000
  there is none like you.
You are good,
  perfectly holy
  and altogether lovely.
Be my safe place
  be my refuge
  be my vision
  be my shield.
You are my Savior
  and the love of my life
  forever.
Amen.

```
