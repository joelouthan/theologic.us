You Are My King

```text
Before Christ
  I was without strength
  I would succumb to the enemy
  day and night.

Before Christ
  I was without glory
  I would lose all of my battles
  and torn to pieces.

Before Christ
  I was filled with sin
  my consequences
  and my enemies
  would have surely put me to death.

But Christ
  stepped in
  rescued me
  clothed me
  gave me food
  gave me strength
  gave me protection
  and gave me the one thing I never have
  everlasting love.

Dear God,
  Let me have your Son
  as my friend
  my beloved
  my Savior
  my love
  my brother
  and my King
  Forever.

Amen.
```
