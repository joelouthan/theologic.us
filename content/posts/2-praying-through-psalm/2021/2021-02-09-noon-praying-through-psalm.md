```text
I will guard my mouth
  and my heart
  to not speak ill
  of those who are in abundance
  who do as they seem what is right in their own eyes
  and live as there is no God

I pray for them
  that you quickly save them
  as I pray this prayer
  and say these words

O Lord,
  I need you to be gracious to me
  heal my broken heart
  for I continuously sin against you

I went about my days
  being worthless and foolish
  disobedient to all of your law
  deceived by the prince of the air
  enslaved by the lusts of my heart
  and the idols of my mind
  living in violent opposition to you
  hated by others
  and hating one another

But when you appeared to me
  on that rainy Monday afternoon
  when I just sinned against you
  you saved me
  I have done nothing righteous
  in your eyes
  but you alone where completely merciful to me
  and you exchanged my sin-filled cancerous granite heart for your tender soft heart
  and you washed me clean
  and you renewed me with your Spirit
  to whom there is no end

I bath in your Spirit
  because your Son spoken and gave me Him
  and now I am a wicked sinner
  justified by Your grace
  and now I am an adopted child
  who now inherits everything
  that you gave your Son

Be exalted, my God

Be exalted, higher and higher

Amen
```
