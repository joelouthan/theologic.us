```text
I repent
  of a life that exacted
  vengeance for my wounds
  revenge for my pain
  justice for wrongs against me.

I repent for being wrathful.

You, O Lord, are the ONLY being
  deserving of justice
  because you have been wronged
  deserving of vengeance
  because you have been hurt
  wrathful
  because you are jealous for me.

Lord, I am repenting
  of when I thought I was you.

Beat this out of me
  make me your servant
  keep me as your friend
  love me as your lover
  Be my Lord and my God forever.

Amen.
```
