```> Psalm 57 (CSB)
For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. When he fled before Saul into the cave.
      Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, 
      for I take refuge in you. 
      I will seek refuge in the shadow of your wings 
      until danger passes. 
      I call to God Most High, 
      to God who fulfills his purpose for me. 
      He reaches down from heaven and saves me, 
      challenging the one who tramples me. 
                                      Selah 
      God sends his faithful love and truth. 
      I am surrounded by lions; 
      I lie down among devouring lions—
      people whose teeth are spears and arrows, 
      whose tongues are sharp swords. 
      God, be exalted above the heavens; 
      let your glory be over the whole earth. 
      They prepared a net for my steps; 
      I was despondent. 
      They dug a pit ahead of me, 
      but they fell into it! 
                                      Selah
      My heart is confident, God, my heart is confident. 
      I will sing; I will sing praises. 
      Wake up, my soul! 
      Wake up, harp and lyre! 
      I will wake up the dawn. 
      I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples; 
      I will sing praises to you among the nations. 
      For your faithful love is as high as the heavens; 
      your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 
      God, be exalted above the heavens; 
      let your glory be over the whole earth.
