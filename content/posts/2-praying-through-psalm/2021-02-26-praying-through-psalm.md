<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Faithful Love
</div>

```text
Everything that I have
  And all that I got
  It is in you.

I have nowhere else to go
  And no one else to turn to
  You are my righteousness
  In you, I will trust.

I will bless your name forever 
  I will worship your name on high
  I will proclaim your word to everyone
  I will preach your gospel to the end
  I will love you forever
  I will fear you for my life
  I will be still
  And know you are my God.

Amen.
```
