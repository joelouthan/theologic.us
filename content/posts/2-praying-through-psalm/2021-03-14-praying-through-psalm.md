Psalms 67 (CSB) May God be gracious to us and bless us;
may he make his face shine upon usSelah
so that your way may be known on earth,
your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise you, God;
let all the peoples praise you.
Let the nations rejoice and shout for joy,
for you judge the peoples with fairness
and lead the nations on earth.Selah
Let the peoples praise you, God,
let all the peoples praise you.
The earth has produced its harvest;
God, our God, blesses us.
God will bless us,
and all the ends of the earth will fear him.
