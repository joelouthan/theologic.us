<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Goodness
</div>

```text
The worst
  has absolutely befallen me
  I have already tasted death
  I have already lost everything
  two times over
  I have nothing

But you appeared
  and rescued me
  one million and one times over
  and you will forever do it again
  because you have set your love upon me
  and you will never let me go
  and you will keep me in your bosom
  all of my days.

If I have you
  and nothing on this earth
  then I have everything
  because nothing compares to you.

Because you have sent your Son
  for my sake
  you have given me everything
  and heaven and earth
  can give me nothing.

Amen.
```
