## The Text

>Mark 4:35‚Äì41 (CSB)  
><sup> 35 </sup> On that day, when evening had come, he told them, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs cross over to the other side of the sea.‚Äù 

><sup> 36 </sup> So they left the crowd and took him along since he was in the boat. And other boats were with him. 

><sup> 37 </sup> A great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. 

><sup> 38 </sup> He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, ‚ÄúTeacher! Don‚Äôt you care that we‚Äôre going to die?‚Äù 

><sup> 39 </sup> He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ‚ÄúSilence! Be still!‚Äù The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 

><sup> 40 </sup> Then he said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?‚Äù 

><sup> 41 </sup> And they were terrified and asked one another, ‚ÄúWho then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!‚Äù
