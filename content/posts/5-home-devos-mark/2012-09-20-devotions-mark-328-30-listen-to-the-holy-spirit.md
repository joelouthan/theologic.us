_What is blasphemy?_

Saying that God is something not when He is (i.e. goodness, faithfulness, just, loving, etc.) or saying that God is something when he is not (i.e. evil, wicked, capricious/whimsical, etc.).

_What if you said Father is something or Jesus is something bad, will you be forgiven if you trust in God?
  
_ Luke 22:54-62; John 21:15-19

_Why do we always respect and be nice to your Mom? What does your Mom do for you?_

_Who is the Holy Spirit? What does He do for you? What would it mean to blaspheme the Holy Spirit? Why can that not be forgiven?</p>
