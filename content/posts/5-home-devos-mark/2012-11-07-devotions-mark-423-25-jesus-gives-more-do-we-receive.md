Mark 4:23-25 **If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.‚Äù And he said to them, ‚ÄúPay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.‚Äù**

1. _If you ask for God, will you get God or something not God?_

Luke 11:5-13 **And he said to them, ‚ÄúWhich of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‚ÄòFriend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him‚Äô; and he will answer from within, ‚ÄòDo not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything‚Äô? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.**

And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!‚Äù

2. _If you get God, will you get more of God? Will God give you more God?_
