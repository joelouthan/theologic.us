**Mark 3:31-35 And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.” And he answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”**

&nbsp;

_I am your dad. Yet, how can I call you brothers and sisters?_

&nbsp;

_When Christ was teaching the crowds, did His mom and family believe He is God, the Christ, the Son of God or did they think he was crazy?_ 

&nbsp;

_Did Mary and Jesus' family believed in Him as God later?_

&nbsp;

_Why do I call you brother and sister?_

&nbsp;

_What does it mean that God is our Father, Christ is our oldest brother, and we are in His family?_

&nbsp;

_If somebody from Africa trusted in Jesus Christ, does that make them our family, too?_
