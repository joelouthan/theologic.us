## The Text

><sup> 1 </sup> He left there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. 

><sup> 2 </sup> When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished. “Where did this man get these things?” they said. “What is this wisdom that has been given to him, and how are these miracles performed by his hands? 

><sup> 3 </sup> Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” So they were offended by him. 

><sup> 4 </sup> Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his household.” 

><sup> 5 </sup> He was not able to do a miracle there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. 

><sup> 6 </sup> And he was amazed at their unbelief. He was going around the villages teaching.
