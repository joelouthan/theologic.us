## The Text

>Mark 6:14–29 (CSB)  
><sup> 14 </sup> King Herod heard about it, because Jesus’s name had become well known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers are at work in him.” 

><sup> 15 </sup> But others said, “He’s Elijah.” Still others said, “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets from long ago.” 

><sup> 16 </sup> When Herod heard of it, he said, “John, the one I beheaded, has been raised!” 

><sup> 17 </sup> For Herod himself had given orders to arrest John and to chain him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he had married her. 

><sup> 18 </sup> John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 

><sup> 19 </sup> So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not, 

><sup> 20 </sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing he was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him he would be very perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him. 

><sup> 21 </sup> An opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee. 

><sup> 22 </sup> When Herodias’s own daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.” 

><sup> 23 </sup> He promised her with an oath: “Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” 

><sup> 24 </sup> She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” “John the Baptist’s head,” she said. 

><sup> 25 </sup> At once she hurried to the king and said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter immediately.” 

><sup> 26 </sup> Although the king was deeply distressed, because of his oaths and the guests he did not want to refuse her. 

><sup> 27 </sup> The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went and beheaded him in prison, 

><sup> 28 </sup> brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. 

><sup> 29 </sup> When John’s disciples heard about it, they came and removed his corpse and placed it in a tomb.
