Mark 8:31-33 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”

  1. Think about being with someone who performed healings and miracles and taught from Scriptures that you have never heard before _and yet_ says something like this, wouldn't this be strange?
  2. Do you think Peter clearly saw what was going on or do you think he still needed more time?
  3. Reread Mark 8:22-26. Do you think any of us could clearly see God and his works the moment we were save?
