He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. And he said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.**

1. _Name some of the things that Jesus taught the disciples -or- what are some of the things that Jesus did recently?_

2. _What were the disciples suppose to tell the villagers?_

3. _What do you think Jesus meant when he said, "**And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.**"?_

4. _Why do you think Jesus told them not to bring anything but a staff, clothes on their backs, and sandals?_

5. _If the disciples learned from the Jesus and did what He did, can we do what the disciples did?_

6. _How do we do the same things that Jesus and the disciples did?_
