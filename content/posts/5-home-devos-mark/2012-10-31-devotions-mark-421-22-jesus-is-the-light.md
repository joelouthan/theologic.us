Mark 4:21-25** And he said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand? For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.**

John 1:1-13 **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.**
  
 **There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.**

******The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.**

1. _What did Christ come to do?_

&nbsp;

2. _How did he do it?_

By being the light

Enlightens everybody

Shines on sin so we can be saved. Matt 1:21;  1 John 2:1-6

&nbsp;

3. _Can you hide from God? Can you keep secrets from God?_

&nbsp;

4. _When you do something bad in secret, should you try to hide it in your heart and mind or run to God who will always forgive your sins?_
