## The Text

>Mark 1:21-28 (CSB) They went into Capernaum, and right away he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. They were astonished at his teaching because he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.
>
>Just then a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. He cried out, “What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
>
>Jesus rebuked him saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him.
>
>They were all amazed, and so they began to ask each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” At once the news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee.

## The Devotion

### Christ taught with authority because he has authority

Be confident in God's Word. If the Bible says it, it is as good as gold. It is as good as done.

>2 Timothy 3:16-17 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

And

>Isaiah 55:10-11 (CSB)  
>For just as rain and snow fall from heaven  
>and do not return there  
>without saturating the earth  
>and making it germinate and sprout,  
>and providing seed to sow  
>and food to eat,  
>so my word that comes from my mouth  
>will not return to me empty,  
>but it will accomplish what I please  
>and will prosper in what I send it to do.”

### Christ has authority over Satan and demons

>And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.”
>
>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.

Satan is not in charge of anything except demons. Christ is charge of everything. When Christ died on the cross, Satan, demons, hell, sin and death were defeated at that moment.

We do not live in a dualistic universe where the forces of good battle against the force of evil. We live in the kingdom of God where Christ has complete and absolute victory over:

#### Satan and demons

>Colossians 2:15 (CSB) He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

#### death

>Hebrews 2:14-16 (CSB) Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, Jesus also shared in these, so that through his death he might destroy the one holding the power of death—that is, the devil— and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death. For it is clear that he does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham’s offspring.

#### hell

>Philippians 2:9-11 (CSB)  
>For this reason God highly exalted him  
>and gave him the name  
>that is above every name,  
>so that at the name of Jesus  
>every knee will bow—  
>in heaven and on earth  
>and under the earth—  
>and every tongue will confess  
>that Jesus Christ is Lord,  
>to the glory of God the Father.

#### and sin

>Hebrews 7:27-28 (CSB) He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all time when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promise of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son, who has been perfected forever.

And

>Romans 6:8-11 (CSB) Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

## The Discussion

```text
1. Do the demons know who God is? Do the demons know that Jesus is Lord God Almighty?

2. Who authored the Bible? Do you believe in God? Do you believe everything He says?

3. Who is the Lord over heaven? Who is the Lord over earth? Who is the Lord over hell?
