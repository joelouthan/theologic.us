## The Text

>Mark 5:1–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes. 

><sup> 2 </sup> As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him. 

><sup> 3 </sup> He lived in the tombs, and no one was able to restrain him anymore—not even with a chain—

><sup> 4 </sup> because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, but had torn the chains apart and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 

><sup> 5 </sup> Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains, he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. 

><sup> 6 </sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him. 

><sup> 7 </sup> And he cried out with a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you before God, don’t torment me!” 

><sup> 8 </sup> For he had told him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” 

><sup> 9 </sup> “What is your name?” he asked him. “My name is Legion,” he answered him, “because we are many.” 

><sup> 10 </sup> And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the region. 

><sup> 11 </sup> A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. 

><sup> 12 </sup> The demons begged him, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.” 

><sup> 13 </sup> So he gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned there.
