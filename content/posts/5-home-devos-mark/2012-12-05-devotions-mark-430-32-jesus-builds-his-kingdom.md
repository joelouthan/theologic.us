 Mark 4:30-32 **And he said, ‚ÄúWith what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.‚Äù**

1. _What can Jesus use to grow his kingdom?_

2. _Do you have to be a certain age to be used by God?_

3. _What does "build the kingdom of God" actually means?_

4. _How does God build his kingdom beyond building more churches?_

God does not need buildings, or organizations or even churches to build out his kingdom. He will use people, you and me, in order to build out his kingdom. For it is not buildings, organizations or churches that make up the Church but rather people‚Äî_his people‚Äî_that make up His Church and His Bride. Not that we are workers to build something grand but the fact that we are the kingdom and God builds his kingdom in us and through us. His work is perfect and will be completed in us and through us.

Matthew 16:13-20 **Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, ‚ÄúWho do people say that the Son of Man is?‚Äù And they said, ‚ÄúSome say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúBut who do you say that I am?‚Äù Simon Peter replied, ‚ÄúYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.‚Äù And Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúBlessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.‚Äù Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.**
