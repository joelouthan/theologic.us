What can I say?

I pray to worship You.

I pray to praise Your holy name forever.

I pray to sing to You.

I pray because I want You.

I pray because I need You near.

I pray because I have no life without You.

I pray because You are my Lord and God.

I pray because You are my Father.

I pray because You are my Savior.

I pray because You are the Spirit inside of me.

And this I know, You have declared Your sweets words to be true (Psalm 119). Your words come from Your very breath (2 Timothy 3:16) and they are sufficient—no, more than sufficient—necessary for life. (Genesis 2:7 cf. John 11:43)

How can I begin to describe the feeling when your sweet words falls upon my ears, eyes, mind and heart?

Psalm 19:7–10
  
**“The law of the LORD is perfect,** 
  
 **reviving the soul;** 
  
**the testimony of the LORD is sure,** 
  
 **making wise the simple;** 
  
**the precepts of the LORD are right,** 
  
 **rejoicing the heart;** 
  
**the commandment of the LORD is pure,** 
  
 **enlightening the eyes;** 
  
**the fear of the LORD is clean,** 
  
 **enduring forever;** 
  
**the rules of the LORD are true,** 
  
 **and righteous altogether.**

**More to be desired are they than gold,** 
  
 **even much fine gold;** 
  
**sweeter also than honey** 
  
 **and drippings of the honeycomb.”**

If Your promises hold true—if You say You will make all things right despite our folly and sin (Genesis 3:15); if You say You will bear our iniquities and our trespasses (Isaiah 53) and You will draw near to us just when we think You are so far away (Psalm 22), then my life and my love is all in Your Word. I have nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to.

Who can I trust?
  
Where I can seek refuge in?
  
Whom have I in heaven but You?
  
Is there anyone on earth I desire besides You? (Psalm 73:25)

This much is true: for you are my God. You loved me and you are always mindful of me even before you created time and space.

You have shown the awesome worth of your love by sending and giving Your precious Son to me.

You have shown the infinite might of your power by giving your Spirit to me.

So what then can I say?

So what then can I do?

All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,
  
I thank you for giving me strength.
  
Thank you my Father God.
  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.
  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.

You judged me faithful.
  
You appointed to Your service.
  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,
  
Your holy name,
  
despite my persecution and hatred,
  
of those who love you,
  
despite my perverted and violent opposition,
  
towards you,

Still
  
I only received mercy
  
because I was lost
  
I was lame
  
I was deaf
  
I was blind
  
I was stupid
  
I was ignorant
  
I was evil
  
I was dead
  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender
  
love, mercy and grace
  
overflowed for me
  
overwhelmingly
  
undeservingly
  
ill-deservingly
  
with your unbroken faithfulness
  
and your relentless love
  
that can only be by You,
  
for You,
  
through You,
  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.

These words
  
out of my heart
  
are true
  
and with all of my hope and dreams
  
and desires and wishes
  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.

I know
  
that you came in this world
  
to rescue your people
  
to pull them out of despair
  
to give your people life
  
to save them from their sins
  
to bring them to you
  
evil sinners
  
at war with you
  
All of us
  
And I lead this group.
  
I am the foremost
  
I am their chief
  
I am their victor
  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!

Yet,
  
in this reason
  
that Your grace abounds all the more
  
that Your mercy renews every morning
  
that Your love never ceases
  
that You
  
my Lord and Savior
  
Jesus Christ
  
might display

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,
  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience
  
for all of those who You call Yours
  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.

This is why I will sing
  
to the God of the everlasting to the everlasting
  
the Triune
  
the Father
  
the Son
  
the Holy Spirit
  
the immortal
  
the invisible
  
the Only One
  
the Creator
  
the Sustainer
  
the Merciful
  
the Peace
  
the Grace
  
the Faith
  
the Immanuel, God with Us
  
the Blessed
  
the Living Word
  
the Christ
  
the Son of God
  
the Fellow Heir
  
the Second Adam
  
the Kinsman Redeemer
  
the Beginning
  
the Means
  
the End
  
the Majesty
  
the Truth
  
the Way
  
the Life
  
the Wisdom
  
the Teacher
  
the Rescuer
  
the Promise
  
the Calling
  
the Fulfillment
  
the Abundance
  
the Host
  
the Governor
  
the High Priest
  
the Prophet
  
the Apostle
  
the Sufferer
  
the Messiah
  
the Servant
  
the Son of Man
  
the Glorified
  
the Power
  
the Gospel
  
the Guide
  
the Elector
  
the Wonderful Counselor
  
the All-Sufficient
  
the Lion of Judah
  
the Worthy Lamb who was slain
  
the King of all kings
  
the Lord of all lords
  
the Prince of Peace
  
the Commander of the Lord&#8217;s Army
  
the Ruler above all
  
the Name above all Names
  
my Holiness
  
my Righteousness
  
my Justice
  
my Faithfulness
  
my Mercy
  
my Grace
  
my Friend
  
my Confidence
  
my Shepherd
  
my Pastor
  
my Elder
  
my Brother
  
my Assurance
  
my Redeemer
  
my Vinedress
  
my Vine
  
my Bread
  
my Water
  
my Rock
  
my Salvation
  
my All in all
  
my Exalted
  
my Glorious
  
my Beloved
  
my Joy
  
my Song
  
my Love
  
my Mighty God

my Everlasting Father, my Dad, my Abba, my heart
  
my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah
  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.

So I will be so very careful to
  
worship,
  
sing,
  
praise,
  
glorify,
  
exalt,
  
proclaim,
  
honor,
  
dedicate,
  
and love
  
You alone.

I pray this desperately and joyfully,
  
in the beautiful,
  
sweet,
  
precious,
  
most tender,
  
loveliest,
  
most worthy,
  
dearest name of
  
Your Son.

His name is
  
the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.
