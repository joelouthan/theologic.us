My wisest Griffen,

It is pure joy being with you, getting to raise you, being in family with you, and getting the chance to love you. In more ways than I could possibly count, you are the best parts of me (and we are not even blood related). I am smart but you are smarter. I have some wisdom but you are wiser. I can think but you are better at thinking.

You are a genius. There is no denying that. What I am the most eager to see is how you will use your brilliant mind for the glory of God. Griffen, you were born into this world, this country, this philosophical mindset of Evangelicalism, and this Christian sub-culture where it is deeply discouraged to think and ponder the deep things of all truths. That boggles the mind since all truths come from God, all matter is held together by the mind of Jesus Christ, and the whole earth is filled with his glory. Why should we battle against the intellect when all truths come from God alone?

In the words of Augustine, “Love God and do what you want.” So, love God and do just that: Politician, Scientist, Philosopher, Theologian, Programmer, Engineer, and/or Professor. Any revelations will come from God. He alone will reveal those things to you. That is why in all spheres of knowledge, He alone is glorious. Since you have access to the fountainhead of all truth through Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit, there is nothing you cannot discover.

But no matter what you do, I charge you to think through on all deep things of God. You don’t have to settle for my faith or your Mom’s faith. God has gifted you to think well. You might run into some notions or some Scriptures that might challenge your assumptions. Pray for the Holy Spirit and push through. Don’t settle. No other religion other than Christianity that works itself out logically and rationally. You might face Atheist and Agnostic claims that the Bible contradicts itself. But you would have thought those things through and with great humility, challenge naysayers to complete their thinking and not to give up simply because they arrived at a place where they are comfortable.

This might sound like a great weight. I expect great things from you not because you can but because you will get to depend on the strength of the Lord to do the work He has laid out for you. But work it will be. This work will not necessarily be easy. I promise you that the more work you put into what you like and Whom you love, the more you will get out of it. You know I am not referring to riches or accolades. I speak on the glory of God.

Griffen, you are a man. I charge you like a man. I speak to you as a man. I bless you as a man. Now you know the weight of responsibility. Now you are starting to know what it is like to care for others and love others. Please understand that I do not expect perfection because perfection is of God alone and Jesus Christ completely his life perfectly for you. You might fail but God will lift you up and you get to start again. That is called grace and we are all dependent upon it—

Thank you for your incredibly wisdom and maturity. Thank you and praise God.

Griffen, I love you so much. I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life getting to see what God has in store for you and to get to know you better.

I love you, brother.

Sincerely,

Your Papa Joe.
