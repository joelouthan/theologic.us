<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My God in Heaven,
</div>

There is none like you!

You are God who sits high above all of my sins, my hardness, my wickedness, my trespasses and my calamity. You are exalted far above all of my gods.

But in your steadfast love, abounding grace, and tender mercies, you saved me! You sent your son, Jesus Christ, to come live and die for me. More than that, your Son rose from the grave and conquered all of the sins, hell, Satan, demons, and death once and for all.

Now I live to you and for you and with you and you are with me and in me forever.

What can I do but give you thanks and sing praises to you for all of my days?

What else can I do but tell the world that you alone are God and you alone are mighty to save?

I will tell the world that if they turn their face towards you, you will bring them in and you will save them.

Because you are God.
