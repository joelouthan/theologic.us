<pre>
<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">My Blessed Lord</div>

How many times, my God,
	must you rescue me?

How many times, O Lord,
	will you come running
	when I call your name?

But I am wicked and violent man,
	and violence has me surrounded on all sides?

But you, O my Lord, rescued me
	saved me
	because you loved me
	from the very beginning.
	
I need you, Lord,
	now more than ever.
	
I am in desperate need of your hand
	to rescue me
	from despair
	and violence.
	
Be my blessed Rock
	forever. Amen.
</pre>
