**How to Be Released and Then Imprisoned**

And I would say that the real hell really didn't start with came next: divorce filed in the County of Dallas Family Courts. While I will not say the divorce trial was the beginning of the real hell, what was ruled in that trial certainly excavated a deep enough chasm to contain said hell. While the court system was somewhat *wise* in not immediately granting my gunwaving-psycho-depraved father immediate custody, their deep seeded racist tendencies really kicked into high gear for they could not give custody of the boys to the boys' mother because, one, she was a foreigner who, God forbid, decided to make English her second language and that, two, she would take her half-Korean, half-White baby boys back to the third world slum ghettos known as South Korea.
