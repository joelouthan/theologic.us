## Pray Then Like This

>Matthew 6:13b (KJV) For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

## Yours is The Kingdom, O Lord

>1 Chronicles 29:10-18 (ESV) Therefore David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.  Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all.  Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.  And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
>
>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.  For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.  O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.  I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.  O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.

So what then can I say?  
So what then can I do?  
All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,  
I thank you for giving me strength.

Thank you my Father God.  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.  

You judged me faithful.  
You appointed to Your service.  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,  
Your holy name,  
despite my persecution and hatred  
those who love you,  
despite my perverted and violent opposition  
towards you,  

Still  
I only received mercy  
because I was lost  
I was lame  
I was deaf  
I was blind  
I was stupid  
I was ignorant  
I was evil  
I was dead  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender  
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for me  
overwhelmingly  
undeservedly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,  
for You,  
through You,  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.  

These words  
out of my heart  
are true  
and with all of my hope and dreams  
and desires and wishes  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.  

I know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue your people  
to pull them out of despair  
to give your people life  
to save them from their sins  
to bring them to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And I lead this group.  
I am the foremost  
I am their chief  
I am their victor  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  

Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
my Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display  

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those who You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  

This is why I will sing  
to the God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
the Triune  
the Father  
the Son  
the Holy Spirit  
the immortal  
the invisible  
the Only One  
the Creator  
the Sustainer  
the Merciful  
the Peace  
the Grace  
the Faith  
the Messiah  
the Immanuel, God with Us  
the Blessed  
the Living Word  
the Christ  
the Son of God  
the Fellow Heir  
the Second Adam  
the Kinsman Redeemer  
the Beginning  
the Means  
the End  
the Majesty  
the Truth  
the Way  
the Life  
the Wisdom  
the Teacher  
the Rescuer  
the Promise  
the Calling  
the Fulfillment  
the Abundance  
the Host  
the Governor  
the High Priest  
the Prophet  
the Apostle  
the Sufferer  
the Messiah  
the Servant  
the Son of Man  
the Glorified  
the Power  
the Gospel  
the Guide  
the Elector  
the All-Sufficient  
the Lion of Judah  
the Worthy Lamb who was slain  
the King of all kings  
the Lord of all lords  
the Commander  
the Ruler above all  
the Name above all Names  
the Wonderful Counselor  
the Mighty God  
the Everlasting Father  
the Prince of Peace  

my Holiness  
my Righteousness  
my Justice  
my Faithfulness  
my Mercy  
my Grace  
my Friend  
my Confidence  
my Pastor  
my Elder  
my Brother  
my Assurance  
my Redeemer  
my Rock  
my Salvation  
my All in all  
my Exalted  
my Glorious  
my Beloved  
my Joy  
my Song  
my Love  

my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.  

So I will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,  
and love  
You alone.  

I pray this desperately and joyfully,  
in the beautiful,  
sweet,  
precious,  
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  

His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

Amen.
