**Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.**

### For salvation

In salvation, people often think that God saves His people from sin, Satan, demons, hell, and even death. That is quite true, but salvation does not begin nor end there.

 Matthew 10:28 **And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.** 

Salvation is a saving from the wrath of God *and* saving to the presence, sanctuary, and love of God forever.

With salvation, comes many things. Consider all that God does in saving us, according to Psalm 40:

- Inclined to me
- Heard my cry
- Drew me up from hell
- Gave me a solid foundation
- Secures my steps
- Gave me a new song of praise to God
- I can now see God
- I can truly fear God
- Now I trust God
- God blesses me
- God keeps me from straying and sin

Then look at verse 5

<pre><b>Psalm 40:5
   You have multiplied, O LORD my God, 
   your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; 
   none can compare with you! 
   I will proclaim and tell of them,
   yet they are more than can be told.</b></pre>

The list of how God saves His people are too numerous. We cannot count that high.

But the one thing we can draw away from Scripture is that God *perfectly* saves us.

 **Ephesians 2:1–10 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.** 

 **Titus 3:3–7 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.** 

 **2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.** 

 **John 1:12–13** **But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,** **who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.** 

 **John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.** 

 **John 10:28–29** **I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.** **My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.** 

 **Matthew 1:21** **She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”**  

Now, let us not discount naysayers and our own experience. Who of us hasn't known someone who was in church, full of passion and zeal, did all the right things and then, at this time, fallen away from God.

One, always keeps in mind the Parable of the Sower. Jesus explained to us this way:

 **Matthew 13:18–23** **“Hear then the parable of the sower:** **When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.** **As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,** **yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.** **As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.** **As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”** 

Two, considering Scripture *and* our life experiences, we know that until people are dead and buried six feet within the ground, their journey is not over yet.

 **Hebrews 9:27** **And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,** 

 **Romans 9:13** **As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”** 

In other words, their journey is not over yet. God is not done with them. 

How are we to respond? If we know that if God is indeed mighty to save (Isaiah 63:1, Zephaniah 3:17) and is the only God who saves (James 4:12), then we have two things to do:

Pray for their salvation.

Obey the Great Commission.

And God will do his saving work, for he does not wish for anybody to perish (2 Peter 3:9) and gives us grace and kindness that is meant for our repentance (Matthew 5:45; Romans 2:4).
