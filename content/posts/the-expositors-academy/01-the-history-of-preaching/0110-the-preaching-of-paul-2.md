Using the Pauline epistles, what is all involved in preaching.

## Colossians 1:28–29 - What, Who and How of a Sermon

>Colossians 1:28–29 (CSB)  We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ. 29 I labor for this, striving with his strength that works powerfully in me.

### We proclaim him

Paul, Apostles, proteges, preachers throughout all generations.

Preaching is teaching. But it goes to proclaiming. 

Him - Jesus Christ 

>Colossians 1:15–20 (CSB)  He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and by him all things hold together. 18 He is also the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. 19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

That is the Him.

Our prominent dominant uniquely focused of our preaching must be Christ. All Scriptures are all about Christ. All of the Gospel is Christ and every single thing he has done.

### how to proclaim Christ

#### warning everyone

admonish, no one is above

#### and teaching everyone

doctrine, theology, narrative, command, indicatives, imperatives

#### with all wisdom

application of truth; practical app; best means to achieve the highest end

skilled living

#### so that we may present everyone mature in Christ

The purpose to present everyone complete in Christ.

>Ephesians 4:11–16 (CSB)  And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, 12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness. 14 Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. 15 But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head—Christ. 16 From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.

>Hebrews 5:11–6:3 (CSB)  We have a great deal to say about this, and it is difficult to explain, since you have become too lazy to understand. 12 Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God’s revelation again. You need milk, not solid food. 13 Now everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness, because he is an infant. 14 But solid food is for the mature—for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil. 6:1 Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God, 2 teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 3 And we will do this if God permits.

#### I labor for this, striving 

Preaching is hard work. To toil. To the point of exhaustion. Agonizing.

>>It doesn't take much of a man to be a preacher. It just takes all of the man.

>>The heaviest object is the pen. To sit at a desk, with the Bible, and work until the meaning of the passage comes forth clear and powerful.
>>
>>Luther

#### with his strength that works powerfully in me.

How do we do this? In the power of the Almighty God within me.

>Ephesians 6:10 (CSB)  Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.

None of us our gifted enough, smart enough, enough to do this on our own.

## 1 Timothy 4:13–15 - Bare Essentials of a Sermon

>1 Timothy 4:13–16 (CSB)  Until I come, give your attention to public reading, exhortation, and teaching. 14 Don’t neglect the gift that is in you; it was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of hands by the council of elders. 15 Practice these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. 16 Pay close attention to your life and your teaching; persevere in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.
