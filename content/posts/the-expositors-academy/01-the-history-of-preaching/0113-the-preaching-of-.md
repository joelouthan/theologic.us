## Epistles of John

### John preached what he saw: the Son of God

The Apostle John
- nearly 90 years old
- silent in Acts while Peter, the lead, did most of the preaching
- 5 books of the canon, Gospel of John; 1, 2, 3 John; Revelation

>1 John 1:1–2 (CSB) What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us—

John saw:
- cross
- upper room
- ascension

Middle man
- spoke about what you saw

>1 John 4:14 (CSB) And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the world’s Savior.

Tip of the spear/missile/bullet

>1 Corinthians 1:23 (CSB) but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.

### John preached what he saw: the Holiness of God

>1 John 1:5 (CSB) This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him.

The holiness of God - perfect, without sin. Preached the holiness of God like Isaiah.

### John preached what he saw: the Truth of God

#### Against false teachers

>1 John 4:5–6 (CSB) They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.

#### But we are from God

>We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; 

Because we are have a new heart, his Spirit and a renewed mind.

#### Unbelievers do not listen to preaching

>anyone who is not from God does not listen to us.

#### Preaching is either or, black & white, right & wrong

> This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.

Demonic spirits enables false teaching

Holy Spirit enables right preaching

## Revelation of Christ to John

### John preached what he saw: the Glory of God

>Revelation 1:1–3 (CSB) The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever he saw. Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it, because the time is near.

>The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever he saw.

What John saw:

- The Glory of God
- King of kings
- Lord of lords
- Christ is reigning now and forever

### Blessed those preach the Revelation

>Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy

### Blessed who are sitting under the preaching of Revelation

>and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it, because the time is near.

## John preached what he saw: the Command of God

God the Son:  
>The revelation of Jesus Christ 

God the Father:  
>that God gave him 

The people of God:  
>to show his servants what must soon take place. 

The angel of God:  
>He made it known by sending his angel

The preacher of God:  
>to his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever he saw. Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy

The church of God:  
>blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy 

The word of God:
>and keep what is written in it

The time of God:  
>because the time is near.

>Revelation 1:11 (CSB) saying, “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”

## John preached what he saw: the intentions of God

>Revelation 1:16 (CSB) He had seven stars in his right hand; a sharp double-edged sword came from his mouth, and his face was shining like the sun at full strength.

>Revelation 1:20 (CSB) The mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.

*seven stars* ἄγγελος (angelos) messenger, angel

In NT, mostly heavenly but sometimes human. You have to go by context. 

In this context, it is the human preacher of the local churches.

And it starts like this:

>Revelation 2:1 (CSB) “Write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: Thus says the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven golden lampstands:

Each preacher must preach the not just one letter but all seven letters **and** the entire prophecy and book of Revelation.

Just by reading Revelation to the congregation, we are preaching it. The preacher's voice will rise in urgency and exhortation.
