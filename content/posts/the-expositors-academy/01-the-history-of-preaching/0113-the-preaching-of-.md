## John preached what he saw: the Son of God

The Apostle John
- nearly 90 years old
- silent in Acts while Peter, the lead, did most of the preaching
- 5 books of the canon, Gospel of John; 1, 2, 3 John; Revelation

>1 John 1:1–2 (CSB) What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us—

John saw:
- cross
- upper room
- ascension

Middle man
- spoke about what you saw

>1 John 4:14 (CSB) And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the world’s Savior.

Tip of the spear/missile/bullet

>1 Corinthians 1:23 (CSB) but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.

## John preached what he saw: the holiness of God

>1 John 1:5 (CSB) This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him.

The holiness of God - perfect, without sin. Preached the holiness of God like Isaiah.

## John preached what he saw: the truth of God

### Against false teachers

>1 John 4:5–6 (CSB) They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
