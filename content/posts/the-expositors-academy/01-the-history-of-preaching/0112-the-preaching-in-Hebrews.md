Hebrews is a reminder that every expositor is an evangelist.

Hebrews is a sermon.

>Hebrews 13:22 (CSB)  Brothers and sisters, I urge you to receive this message of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.

Also, used by Paul on his first mission to Galatia:

>Acts 13:15 (CSB)  After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, you can speak.”

Evangelistic: it is written to unconverted Jews. Stuck between two worlds. They heard the gospel and received with great joy because it is too good to be true.

## Preacher of Hebrews: The Superiority of Christ

This is the main idea of Hebrews. Christ is superior to everything in the Old Testament.

>Hebrews 1:1–4 (CSB)  Long ago God spoke to our ancestors by the prophets at different times and in different ways. 2 In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him. 3 The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 4 So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.

The Superiority of Christ is this. Christ is the gospel. The gospel is Christ. In his person. In his saving work.

Hebrews speaks to these unconverted Jews who know the knowledge in their heads, and they feel the joy in their hearts but they have not pulled the trigger with their will. They must make the choice.

## Preacher of Hebrews: The Necessity of Faith in Christ

>Hebrews 2:1–4 (CSB)  For this reason, we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away. 2 For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment, 3 how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation had its beginning when it was spoken of by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him. 4 At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles, and distributions of gifts from the Holy Spirit according to his will.

>1 For this reason, we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away.

What they have heard: the gospel of Christ. You who grew up in church. You need to pay closer attention to.

>2 For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment

If the law was given through angels was legally binding on every single person on the earth ever for every single sin ever committed by that person

No sin will go unaddressed and unpunished by God. Either in hell or in Christ.

>3 how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? 

There is no escape if we neglect. There is no other name by which we are saved.

>This salvation had its beginning when it was spoken of by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.

## Preacher of Hebrews: The Necessity of the Immediate Response to the Gospel

>Hebrews 3:7–15 (CSB)  Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you hear his voice, 8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, 9 where your ancestors tested me, tried me, and saw my works 10 for forty years. Therefore I was provoked to anger with that generation and said, “They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.” 11 So I swore in my anger, “They will not enter my rest.” 12 Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 13 But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception. 14 For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end the reality that we had at the start. 15 As it is said: Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.

>Hebrews 4:7 (CSB)  he again specifies a certain day—today. He specified this speaking through David after such a long time: Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.

>Proverbs 27:1 (CSB)  Don’t boast about tomorrow, for you don’t know what a day might bring.

>James 4:14 (CSB)  Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring—what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes.

>2 Corinthians 6:2 (CSB)  For he says: At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!

## Preacher of Hebrews: The Entirety of Faith in Christ

13:33

Mind instructed. Heart impacted. Will invited and responds to the invitation of the gospel.

>Hebrews 6:4–6 (CSB)  For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, 5 who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, 6 and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

Enlightened - Know in their mind

Tasted - Tasted that God is good but have not swallowed and devoured and eaten

Shared in the Holy Spirit - but no indwelling nor convicting power of the Holy Spirit

Tasted the good word of God - sit under the preaching of the Bible 

powers of the coming age - Revelation, Prophecy, Nations gathered

... but they want to retain the control of their own life. Control of their own destiny.

>and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

They would intellectually determined that Christ should be crucified based on facts. But for them, they will not choose Christ for their salvation. You holding a line that you have crossed with God. God will not recrucified his own Son.

>James 2:19 (CSB)  You believe that God is one. Good! Even the demons believe—and they shudder.
