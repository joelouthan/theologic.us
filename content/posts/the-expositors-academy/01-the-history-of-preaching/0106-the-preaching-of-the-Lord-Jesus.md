>Matthew 4:17 (CSB) From then on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near.”

## Repentance Preacher

Change their mind, heart and will away from the world and turn to the Lord.

>Luke 13:3 (CSB) No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well.

>Luke 15:7 (CSB) I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don’t need repentance.

### Urgency

The kingdom of God is now.

>2 Corinthians 6:1–2 (CSB) Working together with him, we also appeal to you, “Don’t receive the grace of God in vain.” For he says: At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!

## Relentless Preacher

Not occasional but always consistently constantly preaching. Itinerant preacher.

>Matthew 4:23 (CSB) Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.

Never information but persuading

In comparison, we preach so so little compared to our Christ.

## Heart Preacher

Others preached religion of tasks. Christ preached straight to the purity and motives of the heart.

Look no further than the Sermon on the Mount:

>Matthew 5:1–12 (CSB) When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to teach them, saying: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the humble, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. “You are blessed when they insult you and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of me. Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

We must preach directly to the heart. 

## Bible Preacher

The Expositor. Took Scripture and exposited, explained and fulfilled the word.

>Matthew 5:17 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.

But look at the call of the preacher:

>Matthew 5:18–19 (CSB) For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished. **Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.**

We are to never water down the word of God.

>**But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.**

But we are to teach these commands and give full honor.

## Righteous Preacher

Holiness preacher. Christ never lowered the standard to meet the culture of mankind.

>Matthew 5:20 (CSB) For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.

>Matthew 5:48 (CSB) Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

## Moral Preacher

Preached the law evangelistically to expose sin in us.
