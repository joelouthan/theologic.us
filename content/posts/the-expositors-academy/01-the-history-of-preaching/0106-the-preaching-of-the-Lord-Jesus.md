The Greatest Prophet

The Greatest Teacher

The Greatest Expositor

The Greatest Confronter

---

>Matthew 4:17 (CSB) From then on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near.”

## Jesus is the Repentance Preacher

Change their mind, heart and will away from the world and turn to the Lord.

>Luke 13:3 (CSB) No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well.

>Luke 15:7 (CSB) I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don’t need repentance.

### Jesus is the Urgency

The kingdom of God is now.

>2 Corinthians 6:1–2 (CSB) Working together with him, we also appeal to you, “Don’t receive the grace of God in vain.” For he says: At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!

## Jesus is the Relentless Preacher

Not occasional but always consistently constantly preaching. Itinerant preacher.

>Matthew 4:23 (CSB) Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.

Never information but persuading

In comparison, we preach so so little compared to our Christ.

## Jesus is the Heart Preacher

Others preached religion of tasks. Christ preached straight to the purity and motives of the heart.

Look no further than the Sermon on the Mount:

>Matthew 5:1–12 (CSB) When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to teach them, saying: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the humble, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. “You are blessed when they insult you and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of me. Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

We must preach directly to the heart. 

## Jesus is the Bible Preacher

The Expositor. Took Scripture and exposited, explained and fulfilled the word.

>Matthew 5:17 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.

But look at the call of the preacher:

>Matthew 5:18–19 (CSB) For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished. **Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.**

We are to never water down the word of God.

>**But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.**

But we are to teach these commands and give full honor.

## Jesus is the Righteous Preacher

Holiness preacher. Christ never lowered the standard to meet the culture of mankind.

>Matthew 5:20 (CSB) For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.

>Matthew 5:48 (CSB) Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

## Jesus is the Moral Preacher

Preached the law evangelistically to expose sin in us.

## Jesus is the Obedience Preacher 

>Matthew 5:23–26 (CSB) So if you are offering your gift on the altar, and there you **remember** that your brother or sister has something against you, **leave** your gift there in front of the altar. First **go and be reconciled** with your brother or sister, and then **come and offer** your gift. **Reach** a settlement quickly with your adversary while you’re on the way with him to the court, or your adversary will hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny.

We must answer the question, "So what?" Here is the Bible. We explained it. "So what?" We must answer the "so what?"

## Jesus is the Exposing Preacher

>Matthew 6:1 (CSB) “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have no reward with your Father in heaven.

>Matthew 7:15 (CSB) “Be on your guard against false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves.

## Jesus is the Decisive Preacher

>Matthew 7:13 (CSB) “Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it.

## Jesus is the Truth Preacher

>Matthew 7:24–27 (CSB)  “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain fell, the rivers rose, and the winds blew and pounded that house. Yet it didn’t collapse, because its foundation was on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn’t act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house, and it collapsed. It collapsed with a great crash.”

>Matthew 11:21–24 (CSB)  “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes long ago. 22 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today. 24 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”

He shoots straight. Doesn't hold back. He counted on God for the results.

But He is not the Despair Preacher. He is the Inviting Preacher. The Restful Preacher. The Saving Preacher.

>Matthew 11:25–30 (CSB)  At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants. 26 Yes, Father, because this was your good pleasure. 27 All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him. 28 “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

>John 6:35 (CSB)  “I am the bread of life,” Jesus told them. “No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.

## Jesus is the Doctrine Preacher

Christ preached all the Doctrines of Grace. 

John 6
John 8
John 10

Not just reserved for the people of God but those who did not believe.

Look at the preaching of Christ? Target was believers and unbelievers.

## Jesus is the Eternal Preacher

He had more to say on hell than anyone. More on hell than heaven than anybody.

>Matthew 10:28 (CSB)  Don’t fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

>Matthew 18:9 (CSB)  And if your eye causes you to fall away, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.

>Matthew 23:15 (CSB)  “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are!

>Matthew 25:41 (CSB)  “Then he will also say to those on the left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels!
