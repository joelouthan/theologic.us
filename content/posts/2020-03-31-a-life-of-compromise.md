**How To Get Rescued and Then Abandoned**

I am so old that when I worked at the local Taco Bell while in high school, our location still made everything from scratch. Yep, ground beef was cooked in the largest pan you have ever seen And refried beans were cooked a huge pressure cooker with ingredients consisting of: beans, water, and salt while mixed together with a immersion blender connected to a drill that hung on the back wall of the grill.

Since then, I have primarily worked as two things: Combat Photographer in the US Air Force (which my career ended short because I missed my dentist appointment) and since 1996, a worker bee in Information Technology. Having a long, successful (re: gainfully employed and *employable*) IT career meant that you had to be decent at documentation.  I mention all of this to say that I titled this particular chapter as if it were one of the thousands of HOW-TO articles I have written in my career.

So, in short, this is how to get rescued and then subsequently abandoned:

	1. Be a five year old boy

And in my experience, that is it.

Understandably, that is an huge oversimplification. And yet, based on the amount of experience and the tiny amount of answers I have received, that is the best answer I have.

So, here is that story.

One could assume that if your husband is great at waving handguns at local cops, one could *assume* that your marriage and relationship is not overall stellar. One could *surmise* that there may be considerable amount of trouble, dysfunctionality and dare I say, *abuse* within the marriage? I don't think I am making an unwarranted nor an unfair generality. I say this because what my mom did soon after would confirm my suspicions:

My mother, took her two baby boys, and ran away.

Now here we go. Up until this point, nothing really made sense. But looking back, I think this, legally called, *kidnapping* had to be the first glimmer  of hope I had in my five year old self. 

Now, it wasn't perfect. I distinctly remembered living in several strangers' homes and run-down motels while on the lam. I know it wasn't particularly *safe* since I remembered being hit with a cane from some old guy yelling at me in what I could assume was the Korean language (didn't understand it and he looked Korean). But one pleasant memory I had before being found by my dad, my grandmother, and Rylie was my mom becoming friends with this nurse and her little girl. The moms would chit-chat over coffee and morning airings of Press Your Luck while the nurse's daughter, my brother and I would play with toys and jump on motel beds. Sweet, sweet times. But those sweet times came to abrupt halt as I stood around in the motel parking lot looking up at my dad, grandma, and Rylie trying to figure out, "Ok, I am back to being unsafe. Now what?"

*Oh little boy, if you only knew what special hell you were about to endure.*

Despite the amount of insane crap that little boy had endured up until that point, there was absolutely no frame of reference for what will take place over the next seven years.

And I would say that the real hell really didn't start with came next: divorce filed in the County of Dallas Family Courts. While I will not say the divorce trial was the beginning of the real hell, it certainly excavated a deep enough chasm to contain said hell. Because the court system was somewhat *wise* in not immediately granting my gunwaving-psycho-depraved father immediate custody, their high levels of racist tendencies really kicked into high gear because they could not give custody to the boys' mother because she was a foreigner who, God forbid, decided to make English her second language and that she would take her half-Korean, half-White baby boys back to the third world slum ghettos known as South Korea.
