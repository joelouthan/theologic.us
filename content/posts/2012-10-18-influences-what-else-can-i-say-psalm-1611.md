This is Love, Election, Calling, Atonement, Justification, Propitiation, Expiation, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification rolled into one.

Even typing these words, meagerly and fumblingly, is drawing away from the sheer beauty, breath snatching, eye-rubbing gorgeousness, ever-swelling joy, tear-pouring grace and heart-bursting love that is this one verse.

Psalm 16:11
  
 **You make known to me the path of life;
  
in your presence there is fullness of joy;
  
at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.**

All of God&#8217;s precious love and promises wrapped up nicely.

No other gods promise such things.

No other philosophies can even possibly obtain.

The world has none of this.

Knowledge lacks the science.

Literature lacks the story.

Poetry lacks the verse.

Entertainment is dull in comparison.

Religions fall short.

Man is without.

God is my all _in all_.
