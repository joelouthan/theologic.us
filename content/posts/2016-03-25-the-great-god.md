<pre><blockquote>
  Let me know the need of renovation as well as
  of forgiveness,
  in order to serve and enjoy thee for ever.
  I come to thee in the all-prevailing name of Jesus,
  with nothing of my own to plead,
  no works, no worthiness, no promises.
</blockquote></pre>

&#8211; from The Great God
