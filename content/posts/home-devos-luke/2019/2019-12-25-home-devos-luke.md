  <b>Luke 1:46–55 (CSB)
  And Mary said: 
      My soul magnifies the Lord, 
      and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
      because he has looked with favor 
      on the humble condition of his servant. 
      Surely, from now on all generations 
      will call me blessed, 
      because the Mighty One 
      has done great things for me, 
      and his name is holy. 
      His mercy is from generation to generation 
      on those who fear him. 
      He has done a mighty deed with his arm; 
      he has scattered the proud 
      because of the thoughts of their hearts; 
      he has toppled the mighty from their thrones 
      and exalted the lowly. 
      He has satisfied the hungry with good things 
      and sent the rich away empty. 
      He has helped his servant Israel, 
      remembering his mercy 
      to Abraham and his descendants forever, 
      just as he spoke to our ancestors.</b>

Revelations 15:3-4 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,  
“Great and amazing are your deeds,  
      O Lord God the Almighty!  
      Just and true are your ways,  
      O King of the nations!  
      Who will not fear, O Lord,  
      and glorify your name?  
      For you alone are holy.  
      All nations will come  
      and worship you,  
      for your righteous acts have been revealed."

Adam and Eve?

John the Apostle?

Paul?

Nebuchadnezzar?

Daniel 4:28–35 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, and the king answered and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?” While the words were still in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.” Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers, and his nails were like birds’ claws.

Who is like you, God?

Daniel 5:18–22 (ESV) O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty. And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled. But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him. He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will. And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,
