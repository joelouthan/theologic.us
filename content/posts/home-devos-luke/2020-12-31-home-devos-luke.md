## Christ Calls Us to Proclaim

Luke 9:1–6 (CSB) Summoning the Twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.  Then he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

“Take nothing for the road,” he told them, “no staff, no traveling bag, no bread, no money; and don’t take an extra shirt.  Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.  If they do not welcome you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.”  So they went out and traveled from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.

Matthew 28:16–20 (CSB) The eleven disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.  When they saw him, they worshiped, but some doubted.  Jesus came near and said to them, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.  Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

Mark 16:14–20 (CSB) Later he appeared to the Eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he had risen.  Then he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.  Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.  And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;  they will pick up snakes; if they should drink anything deadly, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.”

So the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the accompanying signs.]

Luke 24:44–49 (CSB) He told them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”  Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.  He also said to them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead the third day,  and repentance for forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.  You are witnesses of these things.  And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. As for you, stay in the city until you are empowered from on high.”

Acts 1:6–8 (CSB) So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”

He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”

## Christ Call Us to Absolute Truth

Luke 9:7–9 (CSB) Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was going on. He was perplexed, because some said that John had been raised from the dead,  some that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.  “I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this I hear such things about?” And he wanted to see him.

## Christ Calls Us to Utterly Depend on Him

Luke 9:10–17 (CSB) When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all that they had done. He took them along and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.  When the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.  Late in the day, the Twelve approached and said to him, “Send the crowd away, so that they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find food and lodging, because we are in a deserted place here.”  “You give them something to eat,” he told them. “We have no more than five loaves and two fish,” they said, “unless we go and buy food for all these people.”  (For about five thousand men were there.)

Then he told his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”  They did what he said, and had them all sit down.  Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them. He kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.  Everyone ate and was filled. They picked up twelve baskets of leftover pieces.

## Christ Calls Us to Worship God

Luke 9:18–20 (CSB) While he was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”  They answered, “John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back.”  “But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am?”

Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”

## Christ Calls Us to Give Up Sin

Luke 9:21–22 (CSB) But he strictly warned and instructed them to tell this to no one,  saying, “It is necessary that the Son of Man suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised the third day.”

2 Corinthians 5:21 (CSB) He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

## Christ Calls Us to Take Up Our Cross

Luke 9:23–27 (CSB) Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.  For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will save it.  For what does it benefit someone if he gains the whole world, and yet loses or forfeits himself?  For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and the holy angels.  Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”

## Christ Calls Us to Glory

Luke 9:28–36 (CSB) About eight days after this conversation, he took along Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.  As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white.  Suddenly, two men were talking with him—Moses and Elijah.  They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.  Peter and those with him were in a deep sleep, and when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.  As the two men were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it’s good for us to be here. Let’s set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he was saying.  

While he was saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. They became afraid as they entered the cloud.  Then a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the Chosen One; listen to him!”  

After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent, and at that time told no one what they had seen.

John 1:14 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

## Christ Calls Us to Freedom

Luke 9:37–43a (CSB) The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.  Just then a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, because he’s my only child.  A spirit seizes him; suddenly he shrieks, and it throws him into convulsions until he foams at the mouth; severely bruising him, it scarcely ever leaves him.  I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.”  Jesus replied, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”  As the boy was still approaching, the demon knocked him down and threw him into severe convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.  And they were all astonished at the greatness of God.

Colossians 1:13–14 (CSB) He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.  In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

Colossians 2:13–15 (CSB) And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses.  He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.  He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

Romans 8:20–21 (CSB) For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope  that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.

## Christ Calls Us to Believe

Luke 9:43b–45 (CSB) While everyone was amazed at all the things he was doing, he told his disciples,  “Let these words sink in: The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.”  But they did not understand this statement; it was concealed from them so that they could not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.

John 6:60–71 (CSB) Therefore, when many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept it?”  Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, asked them, “Does this offend you?  Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?  The Spirit is the one who gives life. The flesh doesn’t help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.  But there are some among you who don’t believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him.)  He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father.”

From that moment many of his disciples turned back and no longer accompanied him.  So Jesus said to the Twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”  Simon Peter answered, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life.  We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”  Jesus replied to them, “Didn’t I choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.”  He was referring to Judas, Simon Iscariot’s son, one of the Twelve, because he was going to betray him.

## Christ Calls Us to Our Proper Place

Luke 9:46–48 (CSB) An argument started among them about who was the greatest of them.  But Jesus, knowing their inner thoughts, took a little child and had him stand next to him.  He told them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes him who sent me. For whoever is least among you—this one is great.”

James 4:6–10 (CSB) But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says: God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.  Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

## Christ Calls Us to Unity

Luke 9:49–50 (CSB) John responded, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow us.”  “Don’t stop him,” Jesus told him, “because whoever is not against you is for you.”

```text
Do all churches do the exact same thing?

Do all churches believe the exact same way? Give some examples?

How are churches united in which ways?

If all churches believe in the same Christ, why do they do things different from church to church?

If other people believe and obey Christ, can they ever be our enemies? Are they our friends or are they more than that? What does God call them?
```

## Christ Calls Us to Grace

Luke 9:51–56 (CSB) When the days were coming to a close for him to be taken up, he determined to journey to Jerusalem.  He sent messengers ahead of himself, and on the way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make preparations for him.  But they did not welcome him, because he determined to journey to Jerusalem.  When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?”  But he turned and rebuked them,  and they went to another village.

## Christ Calls Us to Follow Him

Luke 9:57–62 (CSB) As they were traveling on the road someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”  Jesus told him, “Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”  Then he said to another, “Follow me.” “Lord,” he said, “first let me go bury my father.”  But he told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and spread the news of the kingdom of God.”  Another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me go and say good-bye to those at my house.”  But Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”
