Luke 1:67‚Äì80 (CSB)  
Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:  
      Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,  
      because he has visited  
      and provided redemption for his people.  
      He has raised up a horn of salvation for us  
      in the house of his servant David,  
      just as he spoke by the mouth  
      of his holy prophets in ancient times;  
      salvation from our enemies  
      and from the hand of those who hate us.  
      He has dealt mercifully with our ancestors  
      and remembered his holy covenant‚Äî  
      the oath that he swore to our father Abraham.  
      He has given us the privilege,  
      since we have been rescued  
      from the hand of our enemies,  
      to serve him without fear  
      in holiness and righteousness  
      in his presence all our days.  
      And you, child, will be called  
      a prophet of the Most High,  
      for you will go before the Lord  
      to prepare his ways,  
      to give his people knowledge of salvation  
      through the forgiveness of their sins.  
      Because of our God‚Äôs merciful compassion,  
      the dawn from on high will visit us  
      to shine on those who live in darkness  
      and the shadow of death,  
      to guide our feet into the way of peace.  

The child grew up and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

Giving Zechariah's prophesy, what did the Old Testament reveal about God and what He promised He will do for his people?

What was Zechariah's son called to do?

What are we called to do if we believe and trust in God?
