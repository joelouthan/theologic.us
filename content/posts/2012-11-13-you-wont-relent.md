<pre>You won’t relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours

I’ll set You as a seal upon my heart
As a seal upon my arm
For there is love that is as strong as death
Jealousy demanding as the grave
Many waters cannot quench this love

<em>Come be the fire inside of me
Come be the flame upon my heart
come be the fire inside of me
Until You and I are one</em></pre>
