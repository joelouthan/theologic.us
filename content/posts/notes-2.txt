Psalm 38

My Everlasting Father,

I will never forget
the moment
when I stood
and asked for help
I was being tormented 
and persecuted
for the sake of sin
and I have always been low
because of other people's sin

But those people
who are not my enemies
are not in my control.

When I stood
and I begged,
"They keep doing this to me,
help me to control myself
help me to cease
giving myself
the permission to sin
against the Holy God."

And then
and only then
did you send help
you answered my cries
and you begun the healing
and the renewing of the mind.

Even in the midst of your presence
I got frightened
as a wounded dog
and I ran
because I did not know
what I was going to do
or how painful it was going to be.

My God,
you did not stop
you did not flinch
you pursue me
you sought me out
when i ran from your sweet love.

And you captured me
and you continued your work.

Only You,
could have done this.
Only you,
could have set me free
Only you,
could have loved me
in the way that I needed the most.

God,
write your word
upon my heart
and seal it with your Spirit
and purchase me with your Som
and make me like your child.

Keep me
do not lose me
I adore you
now and always.

Amen.

Psalm 39

The King of my Soul,

In fury,
wrath
injustice
vengeance
rage
and anger
I cried out
not in righteousness of your Son
but if I examine my heart for a second
in my own self-righteousness.

I share
posts
memes
quotes
to try to take away the pain
when I should have been grieving
crying
intercessing
and praying
because you have saw our initquity
and you have withheld your mercy
and you have judged our land
unholy and unpleasing
to you.

My God,
make me ready
for what you are about to do
make me ready
to be taken in by you
make me ready
so that your Son will come back
now
today
right now
so that i can be with you.

Every person
that I have ever come across 
save them
save them now
save them quickly
do not hesitate 
strip their pride
crack their heart open
step into their eternity
and predestined to you
the only and only God
who alone is mighty to save.

Save them Lord
Save them to the utmost
Save them now.
Take us home.
None of us are waiting for anything worthwhile
because nothing that we could ever desire 
compares to you.

We need you
desparately
right now

Come Lord Jesus.
Come quickly
Amen and amen.

Psalm 40

You called upon me
and I am your servant
and I heard your voice

I will wait upon you
to give me the command
to preaching your good news
to the lost
the lonely
the widowed
the orphan
the prisoner.

I have waited for years
and I will wait
until you shower me with grace
until you fill me with your Spirit
like you did with your Son
and you open my mouth
they will not hear my voice
nor will they hear my words
they will hear you
calling to them
speaking to them
raising the name of your Son
Jesus Christ
far above their sin and idols
and draw everyone to you.

So until that faithful day
when you judged me faithful
and appointed to your service
I will sit still
and wait upon the Lord
I will meditate on your precious love
I will praying and seek your face
I will rejoice and be glad in you.

I will praise your holy name
forever and ever.

Amen.

Psalm 41

I will guard my mouth
and my heart
to not speak ill
of those who are in abundance
who do as they seem what is right in their own eyes
and live as there is no God.

I pray for them
that you quickly save them
as I pray this prayer
and say these words.

O Lord,
I need you to be gracious to me
heal my broken heart
for I continuously sin against you.

I went about my days
being worthless and foolish
disobedient to all of your law
decieved by the prince of the air
enslaved by the lusts of my heart
and the idols of my mind
living in violent opposition to you
hated by others
and hating one another.

But when you appeared to me
on that rainy Monday afternoon
when I just sinned against you
you saved me.
I have done nothing righteous
in your eyes
but you alone where completely merciful to me
and you exchanged my sin-filled cancerous granite heart for your tender soft heart
and you washed me clean
and you renewed me with your Spirit
to whom there is no end.

I bath in your Spirit
because your Son spoken and gave me Him
and now I am a wicked sinner
justified by Your grace
and now I am an adopted child
who now inherits everything
that you gave your Son.

Be exalted, my God.

Be exalted, higher and higher.

Amen.

Psalm 42

My God,

When you found me
I was a swollen corpse
at the bottom of the ocean
I was a dried up river 
in the middle of a burning desert
I was frozen death
in a icy wasteland.

I was completely dead.
I had no life to call upon you
I had no heart to beat towards you
My hands and feet were death
and I stunk like a rotting corpse
with sin-maggots eating 
away at my terrible heart.

Surely I was left for dead.

But you saw me
and not only had pity on me
but more so
you gave me favor
you lavished your grace
and you extended your mercy.
You saw me
in my desperate wickedness
my unholy wretchedness
my perversion wanton lusts
and you loved me
you cared for me
you saved me
you predestined me
you called me
you justified me
and only because your promises
are the only sure thing 
you have glorfied me.

You are my Lord and my God
there is none like you.

Amen and amen.
