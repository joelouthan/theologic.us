## The Creed

```text
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:
Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended into hell.
```

## The Word

### We believe in Jesus Christ

>1 Corinthians 12:3 (CSB) Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

>John 3:3 (CSB) Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

>Matthew 6:33 (CSB) But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you.

A person with reasonable intelligence can be taught written and reading language. They can be taught math. They can be taught many things.

But I don't care how brilliant you are: you cannot to believe in God.

It does not matter how often you went to church, how many Sunday Schools, Bible colleges, Seminaries you've attended. I don't care how many churches you pastored. I don't care how much you have given to the poor. I don't care what you do.

The fact is for you to believe in God you must be born again.

Here is the greatest news that you will ever receive:

>Luke 11:13 (CSB) If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”

You know why this is bonafide guarantee? Because if you ask the Father for the Holy Spirit, surprise, you have the Holy Spirit. Why? Because of what Christ has done for you and what the Spirit has done in you.

Now that the Triune God has done his work, you now righteously and perfectly desire the things of God. Your heart wants God and you quote Scripture asking God for God. That's because God has put his word in you and sealed you with the Holy Spirit.

Rejoice on this day.

### His only Son

1689:  
```text
the Son is eternally begotten of the Father
```

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

>John 1:14 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

>John 8:28-29 (CSB) So Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own. But just as the Father taught me, I say these things. The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.”

The Gospel of John drips with the the most complete, thorough description of the only begotten Son of God the Father.

The Apostle Paul wraps up the Gospel of John in this way:

>Colossians 1:15–20 (CSB)  
><sup>15</sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 

><sup>16</sup> For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through him and for him. 

><sup>17</sup> He is before all things, and by him all things hold together. 

><sup>18</sup> He is also the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. 

><sup>19</sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 

><sup>20</sup> and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

When we speak of mankind, then a husband and a wife beget a child. You see this in older Bible translations: "Abraham begets Isaac begets Jacob begets Joseph". But reminder that humans are created beings and therefore, by the definition of creation, they have a definite start date. In other words, we are not from eternal past.

When you speak of the Triune God and the word begotten, it is the same yet different. Christ is begotten from the Father. The Father brought about the Son.  But Son is always eternal past. So you must say: the Son is eternally begotten from the Father. The Father eternally brought about the Son. That means there was never a time when he was not begotten. He has always been with the Father, living in distinct, perfect, loving, abiding, complete community.

### Our Lord

>Deuteronomy 6:4–6 (CSB) “Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart.

The Historic Baptist Confession starts the chapter on God with this: The Lord our God. From his book, *Baptist Symbolics Volume 2.*, Dr. Renihan starts with this sweetest truth,

>>the paragraph begins with a personalized assertion about God—He is ours.
>>
>>Renihan. Baptist Symbolics Volume 2. 167

Whatever God wants to reveal about himself to us, it will not be everything about God but it will be *truly* about God and we, as his people, know him truly. Let the world say what they want about our God. But the maker of the heavens and the earth, the Almighty God, from everlasting to everlasting, belongs to his people. God belongs to me and God belongs to you. 

>Song of Songs 2:16 For I am my Beloved's and He is mine forever.

God personally belongs to me and I personally belong to him. For:

>Exodus 19:5-6 (CSB) Now if you will carefully listen to me and keep my covenant, you will be my own possession out of all the peoples, although the whole earth is mine, and you will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.”

And

>Titus 2:11-14 (CSB) For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works.

### Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,

>Matthew 1:18–25 (CSB)  
><sup>18</sup> The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, it was discovered before they came together that she was pregnant from the Holy Spirit. 

><sup>19</sup> So her husband, Joseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce her secretly. 

><sup>20</sup> But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 

><sup>21</sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” 

><sup>22</sup> Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 

><sup>23</sup> See, the virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel, which is translated “God is with us.” 

><sup>24</sup> When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her 

><sup>25</sup> but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.

Big facts:

- it was the will of the Father and the power of the Spirit that conceived Jesus Christ within Mary
- the Roman Catholic Church will still teach that Mary is and will forever be a virgin. However, we know from the Bible that Joseph and Mary had at least 6 more children after Jesus:

>Mark 6:3 (CSB) Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us? ” So they were offended by him.

### born of the Virgin Mary,

Why is this so important? Why was it so important for Mary to be a virgin when she conceived Christ?

It was one of the many Messianic prophecies from Isaiah some 400 years before the birth of the Messiah:

>Isaiah 7:14 (CSB) Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: See, the virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel.

There have been times in church history where it was important that Mary was a virgin or not. One pastor exclaimed, "If we scientifically proved that Mary was not a virgin, then my faith in Christ would not waiver."

To which another pastor replied, "If Mary was not a virgin, that would make God a liar. Which he is not."

This supernatural, Godly, out-of-this-world, almost fantasy-fiction yet absolute, theological fact is a base, primary tenet of the Christian faith.

Believe everything else but this? Congrats, you are not a Christian. You are some historical cult or sect (and not a new disbelief) but you cannot call yourself a Christian.

### suffered under Pontius Pilate,

So why this is important?

This makes the life and death of Jesus Christ--apart from any other myth or story in history--and historical fact.

The Roman-Greco empire, the greatest empire in history and for all the gods they loved to worship, was a godless, God-hating nation.

Yet, in their history books, state this one fact: Jesus Christ, King of the Jews, suffered under Pontius Pilate.

There will be some hivemind atheists and agnostics who will try to deny the historical Jesus. But to do that would make you look foolish to not only the world but to other sensible atheist.

Attack the Christ from every angle just reinforces Romans 1:18-25. To attack Christ from an historical angle makes you look dumb and stupid.

### was crucified, died, and was buried.

Here is the summation of what it means for the crucified, death, and burial of the Lord Jesus Christ.

>Romans 6:1–11 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? 

><sup>2</sup> Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 

><sup>3</sup> Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 

><sup>4</sup> Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life. 

><sup>5</sup> For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection. 

><sup>6</sup> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, 

><sup>7</sup> since a person who has died is freed from sin. 

><sup>8</sup> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, 

><sup>9</sup> because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. 

><sup>10</sup> For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 

><sup>11</sup> So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

Or to put it in one line:

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

Not when Christ lived on the earth. Not when he was resurrected. But Christ, Son of God, who is God, died on that cross in Golgotha, that was the precise moment that the sins for his people--past, present, and future--were all taken away forever. And therefore his people, that's you and me, were made righteous in the sight of God.

>Hebrews 9:22 (CSB) According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

Make no mistake. God doesn't forgive sin because he says, "Your sins are forgiven--go and sin no more" like some kind of magic spell hocus pocus.

For the forgiveness of sins, there must be the shedding of blood. Without the shedding of blood--without a death for the punishment of sins--there is no forgiveness of sin.

But here's the thing. If I died then I am still not forgiven. My death means nothing towards my holiness and righteousness before God because my life is marked with sin, wickedness and iniquity. I know this because I have broken at least one of God's commands. God's law is holy. We don't get to pick and choose which commands to follow because his law is wholly holy or not holy at all.

>James 2:10 (CSB) For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.

But because I am in him and he is in me, my sins were placed on the cross more than 2,000 years ago.

>Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

I am saved by Christ. I was saved 2,000 years ago. And if Ephesians 1, Romans 8, and the Gospel of John stands correct, then I was saved before Genesis 1:1:

>Ephesians 1:4-6 (CSB) For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.

Upon the cross, where Jesus died, I am made alive, forgiven of all my sins, my the debt and my obligations stripped away, and every single opposition that kept me from God died on that day and brought me into the family of God forever.

>Colossians 2:13-15 (CSB) And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

Let Charles Spurgeon exposit this text:

>>Let us muse upon the fact that Jesus was conducted without the gates of the city. It was the common place of death. That little rising ground, which perhaps was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, from its somewhat resembling the crown of a man's skull, was the common place of execution. It was one of Death's castles; here he stored his gloomiest trophies; he was the grim lord of that stronghold. Our great hero, the destroyer of Death, bearded the lion in his den, slew the monster in his own castle, and dragged the dragon captive from his own den. Methinks Death thought it a splendid triumph when he saw the Master impaled and bleeding in the dominions of destruction; little did he know that the grave was to be rifled, and himself destroyed, by that crucified Son of man.

>>Charles Spurgeon. The Procession of Sorrow. [Sermon 497](https://archive.spurgeon.org/sermons/0497.php). March 1, 1863.

For my sake, I belong to Christ because he died for me:

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

### He descended into hell.

To save his people, Christ on the cross was done. But to redeem all of creation aside those who would not trust and obey including Satan and his demons. One last step must take place.

>Hosea 13:14 (CSB) I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death. Death, where are your barbs? Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes.

>Psalms 24:7-10 (CSB)  
>Lift up your heads, you gates!  
>Rise up, ancient doors!  
>Then the King of glory will come in.  
>Who is this King of glory?  
>The LORD, strong and mighty,  
>the LORD, mighty in battle.  
>Lift up your heads, you gates!  
>Rise up, ancient doors!  
>Then the King of glory will come in.  
>Who is he, this King of glory?  
>The LORD of Armies,  
>he is the King of glory. Selah

>Acts 2:24 (CSB) God raised him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by death.

>Ephesians 4:9-10 (CSB) But what does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower parts of the earth? The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens, to fill all things.

>Revelation 1:17-18 (CSB) When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid. I am the First and the Last, and the Living One. I was dead, but look — I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades.

Shall what beheld Christ since he has done everything--fixed everything once broken by the first Adam?

>Daniel 7:9-14 (CSB) “As I kept watching,  
>thrones were set in place,  
>and the Ancient of Days took his seat.  
>His clothing was white like snow,  
>and the hair of his head like whitest wool.  
>His throne was flaming fire;  
>its wheels were blazing fire.  
>A river of fire was flowing,  
>coming out from his presence.  
>Thousands upon thousands served him;  
>ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.  
>The court was convened,  
>and the books were opened.  
>  
>“I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time. I continued watching in the night visions,  
>and suddenly one like a son of man  
>was coming with the clouds of heaven.  
>  
>He approached the Ancient of Days  
>and was escorted before him.  
>He was given dominion  
>and glory and a kingdom,  
>so that those of every people,  
>nation, and language  
>should serve him.  
>His dominion is an everlasting dominion  
>that will not pass away,  
>and his kingdom is one  
>that will not be destroyed.

From the decree and the sovereign grace of the Father by the power of the Almighty Spirit, all authority and dominion and power and honor has been given to Christ our Savior. That is why we call him King of kings and Lord of lords.

>Philippians 2:5-11 (CSB)  
>Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus,  
>who, existing in the form of God,  
>did not consider equality with God  
>as something to be exploited.  
>Instead he emptied himself  
>by assuming the form of a servant,  
>taking on the likeness of humanity.  
>And when he had come as a man,  
>he humbled himself by becoming obedient  
>to the point of death —  
>even to death on a cross.  
>For this reason God highly exalted him  
>and gave him the name  
>that is above every name,  
>so that at the name of Jesus  
>every knee will bow —  
>in heaven and on earth  
>and under the earth —  
>and every tongue will confess  
>that Jesus Christ is Lord,  
>to the glory of God the Father.
