## The Word

>Genesis 49:22–26 (CSB)  
><sup>22</sup> Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine beside a spring; its branches climb over the wall. 

><sup>23</sup> The archers attacked him, shot at him, and were hostile toward him. 

><sup>24</sup> Yet his bow remained steady, and his strong arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, 

><sup>25</sup> by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, and blessings of the breasts and the womb. 

><sup>26</sup> The blessings of your father excel the blessings of my ancestors and the bounty of the ancient hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers.

## The Belief

### I believe

>Hebrews 11:6 (CSB) Now without faith it is impossible to please God, since the one who draws near to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

In around 400AD, there was a new teaching from the Bible circling around the church from a man named Pelagius. He started to spread the teaching that mankind was not in fact infected, broken, and corrupted by sin of Adam but in fact, we were born free from sin and we only sin due to ongoing bad habits.

To that end, if we can break the bad habits, we can live in freedom from sin.

That sounds amazing accept for one thing: humans cannot break from sin. We can do things that appears good and wholesome on the outside, but inside, in our hearts, will, and minds, we are jacked up as ever.

This is why Christ preached:

>Matthew 23:25–28 (CSB)  
><sup>25</sup> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 

><sup>26</sup> Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside of it may also become clean. 

><sup>27</sup> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of impurity. 

><sup>28</sup> In the same way, on the outside you seem righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

And

>Matthew 5:21-22 (CSB) “You have heard that it was said to our ancestors, Do not murder, and whoever murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you, everyone who is angry with his brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Whoever insults his brother or sister will be subject to the court. Whoever says, ‘You fool! ’ will be subject to hellfire.

What we do on the outside--self-discipline and devotion and abstinence--matter not if the heart has not been swapped out by God himself.

What mankind cannot see--our hearts, wills, minds, souls--must be cleansed by God himself.

The end of Pelagius' teaching was this: if a man could be taught 2+2=4, then man could be taught the gospel and believed and be saved.

But what does the Bible say?

>John 6:43-46 (CSB) Jesus answered them, “Stop grumbling among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to me — not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God. He has seen the Father.

For you to believe, God has to draw you to him first. For:

>Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

And this calling is a work of the Spirit, for:

>John 3:3-5 (CSB) Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”“How can anyone be born when he is old? ” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born? ”Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

You must be born again to believe and enter into the kingdom of God.

All the Sunday school. All the conferences. All the Christian private school. All the catechism. All the Bible colleges. All the seminaries. All the books. No matter how many times you read the Bible. It matters not until the Spirit opens your eyes to see the glory of God, for:

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

You know what is the real spectacular amazing truth? If you ask for God, you will get God.

>Luke 11:9-13 (CSB) “So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, **how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?** ”

Who gives faith in God? Who gives belief in God? Who gives understanding God? Who gives repentance to God?

If you are reading the Scriptures and cannot understand or you are hearing this and cannot believe, I double dog dare you to ask God for God. Try it. I dare you.

Because Christ himself said that if you ask the Father, he will give you the Holy Spirit.

But check this out: because of what Christ has done, God does not visit for a little while. If you ask God, you get God forever.

If you want to believe, you must ask him.

But can I tell you something? If you have the will to ask God for God, that is a good and holy thing. And not to believe is unholy. If you can ask God for God, rest assure that the Triune God dwells in you.
