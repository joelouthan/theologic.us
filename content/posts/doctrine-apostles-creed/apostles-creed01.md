## The Word

>Genesis 49:22â€“26 (CSB)  
><sup>22</sup> Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine beside a spring; its branches climb over the wall. 

><sup>23</sup> The archers attacked him, shot at him, and were hostile toward him. 

><sup>24</sup> Yet his bow remained steady, and his strong arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, 

><sup>25</sup> by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, and blessings of the breasts and the womb. 

><sup>26</sup> The blessings of your father excel the blessings of my ancestors and the bounty of the ancient hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
