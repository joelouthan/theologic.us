## The Text

>Ephesians 4:10–16 (CSB)  
><sup>10</sup> The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens, to fill all things. 

><sup>11</sup> And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, 

><sup>12</sup> to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, 

><sup>13</sup> until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness. 

><sup>14</sup> Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. 

><sup>15</sup> But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head—Christ. 

><sup>16</sup> From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.

## The Creed

```text
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
the Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:
Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended into hell.

The third day He arose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.

Amen.
```

## The Word

>Matthew 24:24-25 (CSB) For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Take note: I have told you in advance.

## The Belief

>Matthew 23:1–7 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples: 

><sup>2</sup> “The scribes and the Pharisees are seated in the chair of Moses. 

><sup>3</sup> Therefore do whatever they tell you, and observe it. But don’t do what they do, because they don’t practice what they teach. 

><sup>4</sup> They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry and put them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them. 

><sup>5</sup> They do everything to be seen by others: They enlarge their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels. 

><sup>6</sup> They love the place of honor at banquets, the front seats in the synagogues, 

><sup>7</sup> greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by people.

### What we believe is historical

### What we believe is accurate

### What we believe is Biblical

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Response

>Genesis 2:16-17 (CSB) And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree of the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die.”

>Genesis 3:2-5 (CSB) The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” “No! You will certainly not die,” the serpent said to the woman. “In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

>Hosea 4:6 (CSB) My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving as my priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your sons.
