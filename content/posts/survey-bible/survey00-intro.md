## The Text

>John 1:1 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

## The Introduction

A few months back, I was introduced to a pastor and evangelist in Kenya named Alex. Alex and I developed a great relationship--exhorting and encouraging each other to press on to Christ. I have witness his ordination and his preaching the gospel to the most remote places of his homeland. Out of this friendship, Alex asked me if I could do him a favor:

>>"Would you please come to Kenya and teach my pastor friends and me the whole Bible?"

That is no small task, that is for sure. And as I am excited to teach anyone anywhere God's holy word, I knew that this would take a great deal of study preparation (not to mention some budget preparation).

I told my wonderful friend that budget wise, it might be a couple years. In the meantime, let me start studying.

I would be remiss if I did not mention this one thing. Early in my faith, I was sincerely blessed by [Chuck Missler's *Learn the Bible in 24 Hours*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ3hESj__M8). And early in my faith, I would just redirect anybody who wanted an overview of the Bible to that resource and wouldn't think twice. But as the more I have studied and discerned over the years, in good conscience, I could not just direct anybody to that unless that wanted to do the work of "chewing the meat and spitting out the bones." As much as God used that to jump start my heart into loving his word, there was certainly a lot of bones to spit out.

Despite not being able to recommend it wholesale, I feel thankful to God in a sense. Like my faith and teaching has come full circle in some regard. I started off with a survey of the Bible. And now I get a chance to bless and teach others with a survey of the Bible.

But where do I start and what resources do I even considered.

To do a survey on the Bible, we must start with what the Bible says:

>Luke 24:25-27 (CSB) He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and enter into his glory? ” Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures.

The Lord Jesus Christ, who was and is and is to come, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Son of God who is God, aptly and properly declares the Scriptures are all about Him.

If we talk about the Bible, we have to talk about Christ. My kids asked me, "What about the Old Testament? You will not see the names 'Jesus' nor 'Christ' in there? How can it be about Christ without using the names of the Son of God?"

And that is why we have a study on the entire Bible. Book by book, what does this book say about our Risen Lord? That is what I attempt to answer in this series. For:

>Romans 10:14-17 (CSB) How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.
