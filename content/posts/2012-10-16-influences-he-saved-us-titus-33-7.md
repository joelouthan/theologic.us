When we truly see who we really are, we see our shunning of God’s wisdom; ignoring of God’s word; our turning away from His lovely face; our insistence to the crap the world has offer; our addiction to the pains and sickness; and our desires fueled by the love for ourselves at the increase of hate and apathy towards one another.

When we can honestly see, we see that these are the &#8220;gifts&#8221; we give to the Almighty God: the One True God who is swift in his justice, terrible in his holiness, unflinching in his righteousness and uncompromising to His own glory.

_Why do we turn to such a God?_ He is the only one who can save us. He is the one who promises He will give life. He is the only one has the power to free us from slavery.

_How do we turn to God?_ He said, “Ask of me, and it shall be done.” The moment we stop asking what He can give and ask for just Him, He gives exactly that. Himself. Himself truly and fully. He gave Himself over to us. Now we have him forever.

Our sins are long as the shoreline of all the worlds’ oceans. Our transgressions lay out from the beginning of the west and ending of the east. Our iniquities are as wide as the horizon.

The Majestic Triune steps into our broken lives, shattered cosmos and the fallen world and cuts that line into two.

**&emsp;Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
  
&emsp;&emsp;righteousness and peace kiss each other.
  
&emsp;Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
  
&emsp;&emsp;and righteousness looks down from the sky.** [<sup>1</sup>][2]{#return-note-989-1.simple-footnote}

When He appeared, **He saved us**.

One and done.

Forevermore.

Titus 3:3-7 **For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.**
