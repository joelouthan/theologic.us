<pre>You are so good to me
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in heaven

You ride upon the clouds
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me

<em>You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song </em>
<em>I will sing again</em>
<em> </em>
<em>You are my strong melody</em>
<em>You are my dancing rhythm</em>
<em>You are my perfect rhyme</em>
<em>And I want to sing forever </em>

You poured out all your blood
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me

You are my Father in heaven
You are the Spirit inside me
You are the Jesus who loves me

<em>And I will sing again…</em></pre>
