## What it was

Back in 2020, I set off on a major writing tear writing commentaries, sermons, gospel notes, and devotions on the Bible.

In April 2021, because I had a plethora of high speed fiber bandwidth and decided to take my work to podcasts and live stream.

## What it is

March 2022, God had other plans--moved me and my family (in-laws included) from Oklahoma to Kentucky so that I could be near my youngest children. The move has been a sheer blessing and the grandest provision by God. I cannot tell you of the joy it is to be able to see my children twice a week. A real, real joy.

As a family within the provision of God, we moved to the rural area of Bluegrass country. But with it came certain challenges--the only one worth mentioning is high speed internet. In short, no streaming and no large file uploads.

## What it be like

I take this as God's grace and now I am back into the writing space. But now that I know what I am doing, I have decided to write a Bible Commentary set. I have a great headstart and it is worshipful joy to do so.

I might return to episodes. But I don't want to think about it. For right now, I am just going to move forward and complete the set.
