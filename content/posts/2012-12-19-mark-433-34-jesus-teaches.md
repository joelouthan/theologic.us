He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.**

We have already spoken on how Jesus taught.

_What is a parable?_
  
A little story to tell us something bigger.

_How did Jesus use parables?_
  
He used to teach bigger crowds.

_Did he always explained what the parable meant?_
  
Not always. Only to his disciples.

_Are we his disciples?_

_Does God explains to us what the Bible says? How does he do it?_

_Through God:_
  
Father wills (Heb 6:1-3)
  
Son spoke (John 1; 2 Tim 3:16-17)
  
Spirits brings to remembrance:
  
**“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.**
  
(John 14:15-17 ESV)

**“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.**
  
(John 14:25-26 ESV)

_Through Teachers / Pastors:_
  
**And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.**
  
(Ephesians 4:11-16 ESV)

_Through Parents:_
  
**Train up a child in the way he should go;
  
even when he is old he will not depart from it.**
  
(Proverbs 22:6 ESV)

**“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.**
  
(Deuteronomy 6:4-7 ESV)

_Through each other:_
  
**And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.**
  
(Hebrews 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14; etc.)

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
