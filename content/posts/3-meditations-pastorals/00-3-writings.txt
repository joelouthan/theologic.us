## The Prayer

```text
My Savior Lord God,

I was astray
Coaxed by the world
Deceived by Satan
Corrupted by sin
Hater of mankind
And at war with you.

I have nothing in me
My spirit was dead
My soul was blemish
My heart full of death 
My sins could fill the galaxies
My wickedness covered the earth
I was prideful
Arrogant
Full of stupidity
And surely I would have perished.

But you appeared
came not to condemn
But to save
A wretch like me
When you spoke my name
You called me to come and die with you
You beckon me to come and live in you.

I was the chief sinner
Now you have made me a sweet lover
because you are my Beloved
And I am yours forever.

Lord,
Make my life
A living testimony
To all of those
Who say they have gone too far
Done too many bad things
Call themselves unlovable
That my words and actions
Would proclaim loudest
You are the God who loves
You are the God who reigns
You are God who has more mercy
Who gives grace upon grace
And whose steadfast love never, ever ceases.

You are the King of my heart,
My lot,
My portion,
My life,
My joy,
My pleasures,
My satisfaction,
My God,
My Christ,
My Spirit,
My heart,
My love,
My All-in-all.

Jesus,
You are the Lamb who was slain,
Worthy is your name forever.

Amen.

## The Prayer

```text
Lord Jesus,

The prophecies you have given over me
That have been from you
That have been tested against your word
That would delivered by your Spirit
And out of the mouths of faithful servants
Would you always bring them to remembrance
And remind me of your sweet encouragement
And faithfulness?

My Lord,
I have fought for so long
And I have failed many times
But your strength renews me
And then I can go back to war
And slaughter the giants in the land
And they will all fall
Because of what your Son has done.

Lord,
Give me the faith of your Son
Write your word upon my heart
Never let your Spirit depart from me
So I can believe and trust in you
So that I might not sin against you.

Keep my conscience clean
By continuously gently speaking to me
When I am in your presence
Or wandering in the wilderness.

I have already tried to shipwreck my faith
I am no better than others who have strayed
Keep me in your hands
And do not let me go
For I am not strong enough 
And surely I will die
If I am not with you.

You are my crown
and my goodness
forevermore.

Amen.
```
