## The Text

>1 Timothy 3:14-16 (CSB) I write these things to you, hoping to come to you soon. But if I should be delayed, I have written so that you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in Godâ€™s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. And most certainly, the mystery of godliness is great:
>
>He was manifested in the flesh,  
>vindicated in the Spirit,  
>seen by angels,  
>preached among the nations,  
>believed on in the world,  
>taken up in glory.
