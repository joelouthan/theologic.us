On those who possess actual faith in God:

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-476" title="ut-ballet" src="https://i2.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ut-ballet.jpg?resize=203%2C300" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ut-ballet.jpg?resize=203%2C300 203w, https://i2.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ut-ballet.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]&#8220;It is supposed to be the most difficult task for a dancer to leap into a definite posture in such a way that there is not a second when he is grasping after the posture, but by the leap itself he stands fixed in that posture. Perhaps no dancer can do it–that is what this knight does. Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance. The knights of infinity are dancers and possess elevation. They make the movements upward, and fall down again; and this too is no mean pastime, nor ungraceful to behold. But whenever they fall down they are not able at once to assume the posture, they vacillate an instant, and this vacillation shows that after all they are strangers in the world. This is more or less strikingly evident in proportion to the art they possess, but even the most artistic knights cannot altogether conceal this vacillation. One need not look at them when they are up in the air, but only the instant they touch or have touched the ground–then one recognizes them. But to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime in the pedestrian–that only the knight of faith can do–and this is the one and only prodigy.&#8221;
