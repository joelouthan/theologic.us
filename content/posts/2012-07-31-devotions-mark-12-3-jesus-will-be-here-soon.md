**Mark 1:2-3 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-162" title="jesus_face_shroud" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jesus_face_shroud.jpeg?resize=246%2C300" width="246" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jesus_face_shroud.jpeg?resize=246%2C300 246w, https://i1.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jesus_face_shroud.jpeg?w=369 369w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]
  
“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
  
who will prepare your way,
  
the voice of one crying in the wilderness:
  
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,
  
make his paths straight,’”**

500 years before Jesus came as a little baby, the entire Old Testament spoke of Jesus Christ.

Jesus said it himself:

**And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, Christ interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. Luke 24:27**

_Can you think of any place in the Old Testament that was similar to Jesus? What about David, Ruth, Solomon, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Isaiah?_

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
