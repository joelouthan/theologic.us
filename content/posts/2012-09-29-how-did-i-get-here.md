Answer: God.

Well, that was easy.

In all seriousness, I got a <a href="https://twitter.com/johnherrington/status/251346086185299968" target="_blank">tweet</a> from a friend of mine:
  
<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-709" style="border: 0px;" title="twitter-bird-light-bgs" src="https://i0.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-bird-light-bgs.png?resize=150%2C150" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-bird-light-bgs.png?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/theologic.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-bird-light-bgs.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
  <p>
    Will you share with me some of the blogs/people you read? I love reading and being encouraged by deep thinkers.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Which, in turn, made me think:Â _How did I get here? Why do I think the way that I do? Who has God used to shape my faith in Him, my knowledge of Him and my love of Him?_

So, being a mere Kindergarten pupil in God&#8217;s kingdom, I thought I would take some time and write up what and whom influences me and shapes my worldview, philosophy, theology, doctrine, and love. In no real order, I am going to go through and list out the Biblical verses, books of the Bible, other books, people (dead and alive), blogs, ministries, and relationships that have been used by God to make me what I am now. I do this to help me step back from myself, see if I can see where I am going and more importantly, ask God if that is where He wants me to go.

This is me just externally processing but I am eager to see what all of _this_ will look like.
