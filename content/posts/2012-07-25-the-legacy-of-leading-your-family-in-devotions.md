By God&#8217;s grace, I heard this wonderful message shortly before I got married. When I first heard it, I got what Dr. Beeke was laying out but it seems to be too much. However, when I started a new family, it became crystal clear what I needed to do and that same weight became glorious. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)

You don&#8217;t have to perfectly subscribe to what Dr. Beeke advised here. But pray, let that message sink in and ask God for help. You are not alone in leading your family because God is your Lord.

Consider the criticality of family devotions:

> Family worship time is the most important thing I do in my life. I wouldn’t miss it for anything in the world. It isn’t perfect but it is critical.
> 
> The commander of Columbia shuttle that disintegrated in mid-air was so devoted to family worship that he recorded eighteen videos for his family, one for each day that he was supposed to be gone. How valuable do you think those videos are to his family now? What a legacy he has left.
