## The Plan

How to pray for and contend for Woodford County?

I cannot account for Fayette County not even Lexington. Let me focus on my home and county.

Here are my next steps

1. Begin a master list of all churches located in Woodfood County.
2. Examine their preaching: is it Christ-exalting, gospel-focused, and expository? Are people under the right preaching of the word of God? I must answer this question: am I under conviction of Romans 10 and 2 Timothy 3:16-4:5 or am I not?
3. Then reach out to those pastors and lock arms.

What I find out from that study will determine my next steps.
