Standing in line to attend the Asbury chapel on Wednesday at lunch, I was struck with this passage based on a old worship song rattling in my head:

>Hosea 6:1–3 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Come, let’s return to the LORD. For he has torn us, and he will heal us; he has wounded us, and he will bind up our wounds. 

><sup>2</sup> He will revive us after two days, and on the third day he will raise us up so we can live in his presence. 

><sup>3</sup> Let’s strive to know the LORD. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land.

And then leaving the chapel after only a short time, I thought about this invite:

>John 1:45–46 (CSB) Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law (and so did the prophets): Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.” “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael asked him.
>
>“Come and see,” Philip answered.

I have no hot takes to share. All I have seen that what is happening is sweet and awe inspiring unto God. It was refreshing to my soul on every level. And I will praise God for what he is doing right now.

So, to that end, these are my closest neighbors. Asbury University and Seminary is 3 minutes closer from my front door than the town of Versailles (the city of my postal code).

As because they are my neighbors, I want to minister. But all I know to do is pray--which is the most that I can do. Pray every day when every time I think about them--which feels like all the time. When I come to visit, I will pray for people who needed prayer like this lady from Austin whose grown son does not know God. I laid hands on her and pray that God would save because salvation belongs to him alone and we have no where else to turn to.

This revival is a sweet, sweet moment unto the Lord. Praise God that he would be so good to do something like this in our own backyard. Bless the Lord, o my soul, and all that is within me, I will praise his holy name forever. Amen.
