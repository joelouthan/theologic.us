## The Introduction

Why do a series in the Daniel?

Much like in our [Westminster Confession](/series/westminster-confession/) series, I wanted to do this out my time in the world from 2007-2019 where I slowly read the word and pray over what I just read. From Jeremiah zig-zagged through the Bible and ended with Isaiah, it took me 12 years to read the Bible like that.

My life during that time was marked with loss, grief, death, suicide attempt, marriage, divorce, birth, chaos, and unrepentant sin. Yet, yet, yet, God just became sweeter and sweeter.

When I hit Daniel, I had to enlisted help. Growing up Pre-tribulation (i.e. Left Behind End-Times Thoelogy), I just assumed that Daniel was about end-times.

But when I started this, I had to go to some trusted resources. When I read the commentaries, my brain was blown. I am throughly convinced that Daniel has **nothing to do with end-times**.

And I wish that wasn't such a bold statement in the year of our Lord 2022. But here we are.

## The Recommendations

by Sinclair Ferguson.
Thomas Nelson. 2002.

I love mentioning R.C. Sproul and his great influence on my life. If I had to put someone in second place, that would be my one-time seminary professor, Dr. Sinclair Ferguson. Now, when I say "one-time", I wasn't officially enrolled but by God's grace, got to audit Dr. Ferguson's Doctrine of God. 

Let me tell you the sweet provision of God. Somehow some way, we ended up having to delay classes from February to May where we had to take 13 hours (!) all in one day. And getting to sit in that classroom from 7AM in the moring to 10PM at night while under the teaching of Dr. Ferguson and hearing him expound the greatness and glory of God Almighty. People have their conference moment, revival moment, their "Bethel" moment (sorry, I don't have a better example)--for me, that day in that classroom was my moment with God. I was consumed with the sweetest joy and love for my precious God.

So when searching for Daniel resources, I got super excited to see this little paperback from one of my favorite teachers. And having reading this cover to cover, it did not disappoint.

Dr. Ferguson did acknowledged the pre-trib eschatology take on these certain passage but then taught the reader how it wasn't related to that whatsoever.

If you grew up pre-trib, rapture end-times like me, let me encourage you to stay buckle into this series.

by Iain M. Duguid.
P & R Publishing. 2008.

I didn't want to have just one book to work through. So, based on some trusted recommendations, I decided to give this one a shot.

This ended up being not only my introduction to the Reformed Expository Series (which I now own the entire set on [Logos](https://www.logos.com/product/210665/reformed-expository-commentary-series-rec)) but to the author,  Iain M. Duguid.

This book I could not put down. It is a real page turner. And again, like Ferguson, Dr. Duguid presented an Historical, Orthoodox perspective to the book and the prophecies of Daniel.
