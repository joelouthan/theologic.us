In and around May 2007, it occurs to me that I should start reading the Bible. I prayed and I felt like I should start with Jeremiah.

Every since reading Jeremiah, there were four truths that did a number on my freshly renewed mind (oddly enough, Jeremiah 29:11 was not one of them):

1. God appoints us to Him before we were born:

Jeremiah 1:4-8 **Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,**
  
 ** “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,**
  
 **  and before you were born I consecrated you;**
  
 ** I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”**

**Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth.” But the Lord said to me,**
  
 ** “Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;**
  
 **  for to all to whom I send you, you shall go,**
  
 **  and whatever I command you, you shall speak.**
  
 ** Do not be afraid of them,**
  
 ** for I am with you to deliver you,**
  
 **declares the Lord.&#8221;**

2. All wisdom, strength, and riches come from God alone and even that pales in comparison to knowing and understanding God:

Jeremiah 9:23-24  **Thus says the LORD: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD.”**

3. Sometimes God’s directions are weird. Answer the question: _Where is your trust_?

Jeremiah 16:1-4  **The word of the LORD came to me: “You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place. For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land: They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.**

4. God unequivocally takes care of His sheep even when shepherds don’t. In this passage I was both frightened and adamantly sure that I was called to be an under-shepherd:

Jeremiah 23:1-4 **“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.**
