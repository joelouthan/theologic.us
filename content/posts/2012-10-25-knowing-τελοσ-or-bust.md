For several weeks, I keep running into the Gk. root _telos- _and for weeks, I had to keep looking it up on my iPhone to remind me what it means and more importantly, &#8220;_what the sentence is actually saying_&#8220;_._

And the cement becomes bone-dry when I read this little quote:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;Moses declared that the <em>law</em> was not too hard for Israel to keep. This passage is applied by Paul <em>to Christ Himself</em> (Dt. 30:11-14; Rom. 10:6-11). This is because Christ is the <em>telos</em> of the law for everyone that believes (Rom. 10:4).&#8221; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Douglas Wilson. &#8220;A Pauline Take on the New Perspective&#8220;. Credenda/Agenda. Vol. 15. Iss. 5. 10." id="return-note-1053-1" href="#note-1053-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>

Because of Romans 10:4, I get it now.

What is our purpose? What is our chief end?

Never stop asking this question.
