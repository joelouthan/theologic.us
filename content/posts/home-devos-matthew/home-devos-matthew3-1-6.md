## The Text

>Matthew 3:1–6 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea 

><sup> 2 </sup> and saying, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!” 

><sup> 3 </sup> For he is the one spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, who said: A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight! 

><sup> 4 </sup> Now John had a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 

><sup> 5 </sup> Then people from Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the vicinity of the Jordan were going out to him, 

><sup> 6 </sup> and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
