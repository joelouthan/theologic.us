## The Text

>Matthew 2:19-23 (CSB) After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who intended to kill the child are dead.” So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

## The Devotion

Christ at his infancy and most vulnerable. Yet, he was not ready to give his life up to save ours. That time has not come. It will only come if God brings it to past.

No matter the danger he was in, Christ remain invincible. The Evangelist George Whitefield said it best:

>>We are immortal until our work on earth is done.

>Job 14:5 (CSB) Since a person’s days are determined
and the number of his months depends on you,
and since you have set limits he cannot pass,

>Hebrews 9:27 (CSB) And just as it is appointed for people to die once — and after this, judgment —

If the days of Christ are numbered, how can we be anything less? If we are in Christ, we remain invincible until God's work is done and he brings us home.

Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, did not live a life without fear or alarm. From while he was in his mother's womb, he lived a dangerous life. But His days were numbered until the moment He perfectly saved His people from their sins.

>>We must always bear in mind the purpose of God, in training his Son, from the commencement, under the discipline of the cross, because this was the way in which he was to redeem his Church. He bore our infirmities, and was exposed to dangers and to fears, that he might deliver his Church from them by his divine power, and might bestow upon it everlasting peace. His danger was our safety: his fear was our confidence.
>>
>>John Calvin. Commentary on Matthew.

Like Christ, our works of God have been laid out for us by God. Go and complete that work to the glory of God.

## The Resources

## It Goes Without Say

[<img src="/images/resources/bible-CSB-paperback.jpg" align="left" width="200" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-calvin-set.png" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />Calvin's Commentaries](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17517).  
by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com)I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-sproul-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Expositional Commentary](https://a.co/d/iPO4KvF).  
by R.C. Sproul.  
Ligonier Ministries. October 29, 2019.

If Sproul wrote it, 9.9/10 I am going to read it, use it, quote it, and recommend it. This volume is no exception.

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-esv-expository-set.jpg" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />ESV Expository Commentary: Matthew–Luke (Volume, 8)](https://a.co/d/557ktz).  
by Dan Doriani (Author)  
Iain M. Duguid, James M. Hamilton Jr., & Jay Sklar (Editors)  
Crossway. September 7, 2021.

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.

I am familiar with Blomberg. And I do like this series. This will also be referenced.
