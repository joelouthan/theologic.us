## The Text

>Matthew 2:19-23 (CSB) After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who intended to kill the child are dead.” So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

## The Devotion

Christ at his infancy and most vulnerable. Yet, he was not ready to give his life up to save ours. That time has not come. It will only come if God brings it to past.

No matter the danger he was in, Christ remain invincible. The Evangelist George Whitefield said it best:

>>We are immortal until our work on earth is done.

>Job 14:5 (CSB) Since a person’s days are determined
and the number of his months depends on you,
and since you have set limits he cannot pass,

>Hebrews 9:27 (CSB) And just as it is appointed for people to die once — and after this, judgment —

If the days of Christ are numbered, how can we be anything less? If we are in Christ, we remain invincible until God's work is done and he brings us home.

Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, did not live a life without fear or alarm. From while he was in his mother's womb, he lived a dangerous life. But His days were numbered until the moment He perfectly saved His people from their sins.

>>We must always bear in mind the purpose of God, in training his Son, from the commencement, under the discipline of the cross, because this was the way in which he was to redeem his Church. He bore our infirmities, and was exposed to dangers and to fears, that he might deliver his Church from them by his divine power, and might bestow upon it everlasting peace. His danger was our safety: his fear was our confidence.

>>John Calvin. Commentary on Matthew.

Like Christ, our works of God have been laid out for us by God. Go and complete that work to the glory of God.
