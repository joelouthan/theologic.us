## The Introduction

So why start up a new series? Do I need another series like I need another hole in my head? Perhaps.

We moved to Kentucky from Oklahoma in early 2022 with my in-laws coming with. I started this series in anticipation that we might not find a local church instantly (Note: despite the published date, I am writing this on October 15, 2022. In short, God provided quickly. Praise be to God. - Ed.) and wanted to be prepared from the jump not going to church for a long while. Keeping it all the way real with you: I knew my in-laws would be slow going to church (Note: they still haven't gone. Pray for them. - Also, Ed.) and wanted to provide the word of God to them.

We did end up finding a church by April and have been faithfully attending. It was God's grace I started this series and by his grace, I will finish it.

## The Resources

## It Goes Without Say

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DXb+atXsL.jpg" align="left" width="200" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Crossway. 2016.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!
