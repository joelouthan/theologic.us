## The Text

> Matthew 1:24-25 (CSB) When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.

## The Devotion

What I am about to show you might sound like a stretch at first. But I want you and me not to glance over these two little verses before we get to Chapter Two.

I want us not only to see God in his word but to see God’s grace in the life of Joseph and Mary in order for them to do His will.

### When Joseph woke up

Our tomorrow is never a guarantee by God.

For:
>Proverbs 27:1 (CSB) Don’t boast about tomorrow,
for you don’t know what a day might bring.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. 

God gives all grace for you to obey him. For:

>Ezekiel 36:24-27 (CSB) “ ‘For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. 25 I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### He married her

Before the sin entered into our world, we were blessed with a few things: love, righteousness, holiness, rest, work, and marriage. These were gifts of God. For:

>Genesis 2:24 (CSB) This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### but did not have sexual relations with her

In obey God, we never have to disobey God. Joseph was bethroth to her and would be her husband. Joseph was holy because God is holy. He never had disobey in order to glorify God.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### until she gave birth to a son. 

Joseph and Mary was given a son that was not their own in so many ways. Mary didn’t want it this way but God spoke and she was called. Joseph didn’t want it this way. But God spoke and he was called. And they were given the grace to do his will.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

### And he named him Jesus.

Did they know what they were getting into? No, not all the way. Mary and Joseph desired to be obedient and wanted to please God. They didn’t see the entire full picture but they didn’t have to. God gives the grace for us to do his will.

Let us give thanks to God for he has given us grace!

## The Resources

## It Goes Without Say

[<img src="/images/resources/bible-CSB-paperback.jpg" align="left" width="200" style="padding-right: 10px" />The Holy Bible](https://amzn.to/3FbGqbM)

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com) If I had to pick just one resource (hardcover vs. leather vs. paperback vs. digital), I use it way more in my [Olive Tree Study Bible](https://www.olivetree.com) than anything else.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-calvin-set.png" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />Calvin's Commentaries](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17517).  
by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com)I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-sproul-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Expositional Commentary](https://a.co/d/iPO4KvF).  
by R.C. Sproul.  
Ligonier Ministries. October 29, 2019.

If Sproul wrote it, 9.9/10 I am going to read it, use it, quote it, and recommend it. This volume is no exception.

by Dan Doriani (Author)  
Iain M. Duguid, James M. Hamilton Jr., & Jay Sklar (Editors)  
Crossway. September 7, 2021.

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.

I am familiar with Blomberg. And I do like this series. This will also be referenced.
