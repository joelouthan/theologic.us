## The Devotion

Here was the game plan of God to rescue his people: send his Son.

But he would not do it out of thin air or out of the clouds, although he is God and he could certainly do that.

He was going to send his Son to be "with us" and in a way through us. This was from the very beginning:

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring.
He will strike your head,
and you will strike his heel.

So from this first gospel preaching, we knew that our Messiah would be born into this world. But try to imagine how we would send the Savior?

He would have to be born wealthy, with resources, within a perfect bloodline with people fit to be royalty.

He would be born of royalty (that is a future devotion) but a bloodline not worthy of such prestige.

Look at the list of his family:

- Literally pimps his wife not once but twice for fear of his own life
- Son does the same thing
- Grandson, whose name means "trickster", steals his brother's inheritance and runs for the hills
- Sleeps with a prostitute, who was his son's widow, impregnating her with twins
- Prostitute
- Used to be a child-sacrificing demon worshiper whose descendants were born out of incest
- a finally, a king who would rape a woman and then when she gets pregnant, turns and murders her husband

The worst of the worst.

But who did Christ come for? The righteous? The wealthy? The healthy? The perfect ones?

No. He came for the sinners, the poor, the sick, and the depraved.

>Romans 5:8-9 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.

We are no longer under the weight of being perfect because we are not and we would be crushed by those expectations. We must obey the law but we have always fallen way way short. Christ came as our Perfection so that, in fulfilling the obedience of the law, we *get* to obey God.

Until you know and trust Christ, you have no hope of obeying him. You must be born again into his family--so that only then you get to obey and enjoy God forever.

## The Resources

## It Goes Without Say

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-calvin-set.png" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />Calvin's Commentaries](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17517).  
by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com)I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-sproul-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Expositional Commentary](https://a.co/d/iPO4KvF).  
by R.C. Sproul.  
Ligonier Ministries. October 29, 2019.

If Sproul wrote it, 9.9/10 I am going to read it, use it, quote it, and recommend it. This volume is no exception.

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-esv-expository-set.jpg" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />ESV Expository Commentary: Matthew–Luke (Volume, 8)](https://a.co/d/557ktz).  
by Dan Doriani (Author)  
Iain M. Duguid, James M. Hamilton Jr., & Jay Sklar (Editors)  
Crossway. September 7, 2021.

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-nac-blomberg-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture (Volume 22) (The New American Commentary)](https://a.co/d/4nRKV6G).  
by Craig L. Blomberg.  
Holman Reference. May 1992.

I am familiar with Blomberg. And I do like this series. This will also be referenced.
