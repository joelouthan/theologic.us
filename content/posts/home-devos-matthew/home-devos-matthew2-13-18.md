## The Text

>Matthew 2:13–18 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up! Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.” 

><sup> 14 </sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt. 

><sup> 15 </sup> He stayed there until Herod’s death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: Out of Egypt I called my Son. 

><sup> 16 </sup> Then Herod, when he realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men. 

><sup> 17 </sup> Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 

><sup> 18 </sup> A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.

## The Devotion

>John 10:14-18 (CSB) “I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”

>Matthew 26:52-54 (CSB) Then Jesus told him, “Put your sword back in its place because all who take up the sword will perish by the sword. Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and he will provide me here and now with more than twelve legions of angels? How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?

One of the things that we might have a hard time comprehending is the eternal word of God. When we speak about something we want to do, we say it, then do it, and then it will be true.

God does not operate in that way.

What He says, in any moment of time, is true not only for the moment it was spoken and forever in the future but any moment prior to that moment.

Think of all the Old Testament saints--by definition, these are all the saints prior to the cross of Christ. How were they saved? How were all the believing Jews were saved?

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring.
He will strike your head,
and you will strike his heel.

This first instance of the gospel was given to our first parents: Adam and Eve. From that moment, God does not change it but builds on the promise--the promise that He will make it everything right.

The fullness of the gospel was not completed until Jesus died on the cross. But the details of the gospel did not have to be realized by any of the Old Testament saints.

>Romans 3:25-26 (CSB) od presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

Jesus Christ, Son of God who is God, is the Word Eternal. When God speaks, it is true, will always be true, and was forever true from before the beginning.

## The Resources

## It Goes Without Say

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog by default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource.

I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com) If I had to pick just one resource (hardcover vs. leather vs. paperback vs. digital), I use it way more in my [Olive Tree Study Bible](https://www.olivetree.com) than anything else.

## Commentaries & Books

I don't have a personal insightful recommendation on the following. I just wanted to have a stack of resources that I can check by and draw from if I need to.

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-calvin-set.png" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />Calvin's Commentaries](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17517).  
by John Calvin.  
Baker. 2009.

[<img src="/images/resources/icon-bible-olive-tree.png" align="right" width="100" style="padding-right: 10px" />](https://www.olivetree.com)I mention this because in my go-to mobile Bible Study App, [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com), Calvin's Commentaries are my go-to Commentary text of choice when I need clarification on the go. You can get the entire digital set for your phone (and computer) for about ~~$40~~ **$19.99** from Olive Tree!

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-sproul-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Expositional Commentary](https://a.co/d/iPO4KvF).  
by R.C. Sproul.  
Ligonier Ministries. October 29, 2019.

If Sproul wrote it, 9.9/10 I am going to read it, use it, quote it, and recommend it. This volume is no exception.

<p style="clear:both;">

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-esv-expository-set.jpg" align="left" width="250" style="padding-right: 10px" />ESV Expository Commentary: Matthew–Luke (Volume, 8)](https://a.co/d/557ktz).  
by Dan Doriani (Author)  
Iain M. Duguid, James M. Hamilton Jr., & Jay Sklar (Editors)  
Crossway. September 7, 2021.

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.

[<img src="/images/resources/commentary-nac-blomberg-matthew.jpg" align="left" width="150" style="padding-right: 10px" />Matthew: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture (Volume 22) (The New American Commentary)](https://a.co/d/4nRKV6G).

I am familiar with Blomberg. And I do like this series. This will also be referenced.
