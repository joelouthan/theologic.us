>   Rulers, princes, and principalities: they crouch for my soul. They wait to devour my heart. They do not hesitate to fire a million arrows of fire just to consume my being.

> <p class="p1">
>   But you, O Lord, are my strength, my armour, my fortress and strong tower. It is in you alone that I trust forever.
