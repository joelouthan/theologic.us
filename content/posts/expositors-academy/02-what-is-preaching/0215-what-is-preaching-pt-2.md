## What is Preaching: Exaltational

Make much of God.

"Pastor, what a great God we have!" - greatest compliment to your preaching

>>Every great preacher of God is a preacher of a great God. SLJ

Is there a lot of God in you preaching?

</mark>Exercise</mark>: Examine Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:14-41 and highlight every time Peter mentions God.

>Acts 2:14–41 (CSB)  
><sup>14</sup> Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them, “Fellow Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words. 

><sup>15</sup> For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it’s only nine in the morning. 

><sup>16</sup> On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: 

><sup>17</sup> And it will be in the last days, says <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark>, that I will pour out my <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Spirit</mark> on all people; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. 

><sup>18</sup> I will even pour out my <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Spirit</mark> on my servants in those days, both men and women and they will prophesy. 

><sup>19</sup> I will display wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below: blood and fire and a cloud of smoke. 

><sup>20</sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day of the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> comes. 

><sup>21</sup> Then everyone who calls on the name of the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> will be saved. 

><sup>22</sup> “Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: This <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Jesus</mark> of Nazareth was a man attested to you by <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> with miracles, wonders, and signs that <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> did among you through <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark>, just as you yourselves know. 

><sup>23</sup> Though <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">he</mark> was delivered up according to <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God’s</mark> determined plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark> to a cross and kill <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark>. 

><sup>24</sup> <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> raised <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark> up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark> to be held by death. 

><sup>25</sup> For David says of <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">him</mark>: I saw the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> ever before me; because <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">he</mark> is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

><sup>26</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices. Moreover, my flesh will rest in hope, 

><sup>27</sup> because <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">you</mark> will not abandon <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">me</mark> in Hades or allow your <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">holy one</mark> to see decay. 

><sup>28</sup> <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">You</mark> have revealed the paths of life to me; <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">you</mark> will fill me with gladness in <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">your</mark> presence. 

><sup>29</sup> “Brothers and sisters, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 

><sup>30</sup> Since he was a prophet, he knew that <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne. 

><sup>31</sup> Seeing what was to come, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Messiah</mark>: <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">He</mark> was not abandoned in Hades, and <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">his</mark> flesh did not experience decay. 

><sup>32</sup> “</mark>God</mark> has raised this <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Jesus</mark>; we are all witnesses of this. 

><sup>33</sup> Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> and has received from the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Father</mark> the promised <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Holy</mark> <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Spirit</mark>, he has poured out what you both see and hear. 

><sup>34</sup> For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says: The <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> declared to my <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark>, ‘Sit at my right hand 

><sup>35</sup> until I make your enemies your footstool.’ 

><sup>36</sup> “Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> has made this <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Jesus</mark>, whom you crucified, both <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> and <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Messiah</mark>.” 

><sup>37</sup> When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” 

><sup>38</sup> Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Jesus</mark> <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Christ</mark> for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Holy</mark> <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Spirit</mark>. 

><sup>39</sup> For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Lord</mark> our <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">God</mark> will call.” 

><sup>40</sup> With many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!” 

><sup>41</sup> So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to them.

This is what your preaching should look like. Not your opinions, ideas, hot takes, quips, culture observations, what you watched on TV the other night. The weight, the bulk, the heaviness, the awe, the amount, the heaviest lifting in your sermons needs to be about God and God alone!
