To proclaim ourselves as Christians is to proclaim that we believe and trust upon Christ as our Saviour and Lord.

At that beautiful moment, when God saved us, we hope and pray that each one of us are immediately surrounded by other brothers and sisters in Christ that are willing to walk alongside with us in love, encouragement, teaching and exhortation. This is called discipleship. This is the grassroots of the Great Commission.  It is my sincere hope that no newly saved person is ever alone by themselves in trying to figure this new found faith especially when the cross of Christ has not only saved us to Himself but saved us to one another. Here at ground zero, at the precise moment when the Holy Spirit takes out our hearts of stone, we are then given a new heart and new desires by God. These new desires are to know and love God more and more each day.

But how is it that we are actually saved by God?  This is the question that the idea of Ordo Salutis or "The Order of Salvation" attempts to answer.

But one we start knowing a little of the Bible, the better question might be:

## What did God have to do in order to save His people to Himself?

In order to answer this, we have to fully dive into the Scriptures to see what God has revealed about what salvation is.  We cannot rely on superstition, church history or simply what "feels good‚Äù.  We must seek out what God says about salvation.

So in this series, we are going to attempt answer questions such as, "Does the Bible teach about God electing us to salvation?‚Äù, "Are we predestined by God?‚Äù, "What is free will of man?‚Äù and "Can a person truly be saved without the outward appearance of a new heart?‚Äù.

So in this, we begin with what some theologians call "the golden chain of salvation" found in this passage:

>Romans 8:27-30 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. **And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified**.

In verse 30, Paul did not simply throw the words "predestined‚Äù, "called‚Äù, "justified‚Äù and "glorified‚Äù at us as though their order did not matter.  Paul was very careful in ordering those words in the way that to show what were the steps that God took in order to bring you and me all the way home back to him.

Before we dive into our next lesson next week, here are some questions you might want to ponder over, discuss with others, and seek the answer yourself:

```text
What does predestination mean to you?

Do you believe that God predestined our salvation?

What is free will?
```

Passages to read for our next lesson:

- Romans 8:27-30
- Romans 3:10-12
- Genesis 3:1-21 (What was Adam and Eve doing before God clothed them?)
- Genesis 6:1-9 (What was Noah doing before God bestowed grace upon him?)
- Genesis 12:1-4 (What was Abram doing before God called out to him?)
- Isaiah 6:1-7 (What was Isaiah doing before God revealed His glory to him?)
- Acts 7:54-8:3; 9:1-6 (What was Saul doing before God saved him?)

I am very excited to walk alongside with you in this study.   I strongly encourage you to do all things in worship to God, especially reading the word of God, soak this in prayer and seeking out His understanding and His will in all things.
