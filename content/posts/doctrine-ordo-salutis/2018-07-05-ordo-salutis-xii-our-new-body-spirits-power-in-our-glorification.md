>Psalm 97:9 (CSB) For you, LORD, are the Most High over the whole earth; you are exalted above all the gods.

And how can we even fathom this glory of God? How can we fully look upon God in his sheer radiance, beauty, and majesty without our minds and eyes and hearts shutting down?

It is sheer madness.

And that is exactly what God wants! He wants to be with him forever and ever. With him. Not "the whole earth is filled with his glory” or even "he dwells within us” type of presence that we are so use to and dare I say, at ease with.

But understand what Christ has done in us for us:

>Hebrews 9:25-28 (CSB) He did not do this to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another. Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment— so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

He takes away sin. All sin. For the whole world. For all of his people. And when we are with him, finally with him, we will be with him in a place where "nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life” and "no longer will there be anything accursed.”

>Revelation 21:4 (CSB) He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away.

But then, it is more than removing sin, evil, Satan, demons and death.

He puts in the fullness of holiness, righteousness, love, joy, peace, grace, mercy, and justice. Namely, He puts himself in with us.

>Revelation 22:5 (CSB) Night will be no more; people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever.

Can we truly comprehend worshiping our sweet king forever? No! Can we ponder what it is like to worship with the God who saved us? Brother and sister, there have plenty of times I could not manage my own debt nor waistline. So you know I am not even thinking about reigning with him.

But that is what He said we will be.

The same God who made known for me the path of life and therefore, because of all that Christ has done, when I do get to him, I will experience the fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore.

It is only there when we will finally experience "the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.”

It is only there when we will finally "behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.”

The God who is glorious is the same one who is glorifies his children.

>Romans 8:16-18 (CSB) The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.

I am not even doing a great job of extrapolating the glory of God. If I had the fullness of the Spirit and the highest IQ and all the gifts of writing and communication and had infinite time and resources, perhaps, I could tell you a tiny sliver of his glory.

This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true. Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.

Well, one day, with infinite light, infinite energy, and infinite worshiping my sweet King, I will attempt to write about his glory.

Until then, I pray:

Show me your glory!
