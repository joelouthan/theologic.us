<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  This study is important because exegetical fallacies are painfully painfully frequent among usâ€”among us whose God-given grace and responsibility is the faithful proclamation of the Word of God. Make a mistake in the interpretation of one of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, falsely scan a piece of Spenserian verse, and there is unlikely to be entailment of eternal consequence; but we cannot lightly accept a similar laxity in the interpretation of Scripture. We are dealing with God&#8217;s thoughts: we are obligated to take the greatest pains to understand them truly and to explain them clearly.
