And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.**

_Was Jesus human?_

_Was Jesus the Son of God?_

_Did Jesus have in him, the Spirit of God?_

_Do we have the Spirit of God?_

_Are we sons and daughters of God?_

**Romans 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.**

_Does God love his kids?_

_Does God love you?_

**Parents**: After talking about the person and work of the Holy Spirit, now the opportunity presents itself to talk about &#8220;_What does that mean to me?_&#8220;, &#8220;_What does it mean to have the Holy Spirit within my heart?_&#8221; or &#8220;_What does it look like to be led by the Spirit of God?_&#8220;. If further discussion is needed, a great starting off point is Galatians 5:22-23 &#8220;The Fruit of the Spirit&#8221;.

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our family devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for family devotions.
