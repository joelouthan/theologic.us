A sight for sore eyes.

No words have rang truer except for the Son of Man.

The One God who cross the infinite just to save me.

Now my eyes bleared at the first site of him.

The loveliness of his face.

I look into His eyes and my soul is complete. My heart is joy-filled. My mind now knows fully.

I am content.

I am satisfied.

God is perfect in his work in me.

Now, I will stay this way forever.

Forever, I will stay with Him.

Psalm 17:15  
 **As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;**  
 **when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.**
