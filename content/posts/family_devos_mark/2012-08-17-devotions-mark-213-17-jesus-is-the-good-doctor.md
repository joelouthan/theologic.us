And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him. And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”**

1. _Whom did Jesus hang out with?_

2. _Does Jesus wait to want you when you are really good? Did Jesus start loving you when you started to do good things?_

**For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.** (Romans 5:6-8 ESV)

3. _Did Jesus come to save good people or did he come to save sinners?_

**She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”** (Matthew 1:21 ESV)

**Series**: I have made mentioned of our Devotions on the Internets and gotten a few requests for my notes. So that is what I am doing just that here. Every Wednesday as a regular weekly series, I will share my notes that I write in preparing for Devotions.
