### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q.

>Luke 1:39–45 (CSB) In those days Mary set out and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah  where she entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.  When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped inside her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.  Then she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and your child will be blessed!  How could this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  For you see, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped for joy inside me.  Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill what he has spoken to her!”
