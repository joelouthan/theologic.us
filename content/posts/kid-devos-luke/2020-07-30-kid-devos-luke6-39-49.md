## 🏠 Blind Leading the Blind

>Luke 6:39-40 He also told them a parable: “Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit?A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.

>Matthew 23:15 (CSB) “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are!

If we believe in God and we want to be like our Teacher, how can we do so?

## 🏠 Splinter in Our Eyes

>Luke 6:41-42 “Why do you look at the splinter in your brother’s eye, but don’t notice the beam of wood in your own eye?Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the splinter that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam of wood in your eye? Hypocrite! First take the beam of wood out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the splinter in your brother’s eye.

>Matthew 18:15–20 (CSB) “If your brother sins against you, go tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.But if he won’t listen, take one or two others with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established.If he doesn’t pay attention to them, tell the church. If he doesn’t pay attention even to the church, let him be like a Gentile and a tax collector to you.Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.Again, truly I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about any matter that you pray for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them.”

## Certain Trees Produces Certain Fruits

>Luke 6:43-44 “A good tree doesn’t produce bad fruit; on the other hand, a bad tree doesn’t produce good fruit.For each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs aren’t gathered from thornbushes, or grapes picked from a bramble bush.A good person produces good out of the good stored up in his heart. An evil person produces evil out of the evil stored up in his heart, for his mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.

Can we tell if someone is saved by what they do? What about upstanding, moral people who don't believe in God?

Can we tell if someone is not saved by what they do or do not do?

Is it possible to do wickedness and sin in the sight of God and be saved to God?
```

>Psalm 5:4 (CSB)  
>For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;  
>evil cannot dwell with you.

## Westminster Larger Catechism

Q. 2. How doth it appear that there is a God?  
A. The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God; but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.

## Believers Believe the Lord and Do as the Lord Commands

>Luke 6:46-49 “Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do the things I say?I will show you what someone is like who comes to me, hears my words, and acts on them:He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the river crashed against that house and couldn’t shake it, because it was well built.But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The river crashed against it, and immediately it collapsed. And the destruction of that house was great.”

>Matthew 7:21–23 (CSB) “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?’Then I will announce to them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you lawbreakers!’

How is it possible to do good things and still be a lawbreaker in the sight of God?
```

>John 3:36 (CSB) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.
