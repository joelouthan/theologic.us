### Westminster Larger Catechism

Q.

>Luke 1:1‚Äì4 (CSB) Many have undertaken to compile a narrative about the events that have been fulfilled among us,  just as the original eyewitnesses and servants of the word handed them down to us.  So it also seemed good to me, since I have carefully investigated everything from the very first, to write to you in an orderly sequence, most honorable Theophilus,  so that you may know the certainty of the things about which you have been instructed.

What is it to witness? In the court of law, it is one who testifies to crime that was committed or to the whereabouts of one that is accused.

To witness about God among us is merely more than what we see and know.

It is that God sees us and knows us.

Christ said in Matthew 10:32‚Äì33, "So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven."

Paul goes on in Romans 8, "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs‚Äîheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."

It is any wonder then why Christ will tell those who call themselves witnesses, disciples, and gospel proclaimers in Matthew 10:16‚Äì23 ‚ÄúBehold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."

What is our response? In Acts 1:6‚Äì11, the author Luke bore witness: So when they had come together, they asked him, ‚ÄúLord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúIt is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.‚Äù And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, ‚ÄúMen of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.‚Äù

2. What is it mean to bear witness of the truth?

3. Can you proclaim the truth and live in contradiction to that truth?
