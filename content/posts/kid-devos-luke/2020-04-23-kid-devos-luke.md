>Simeon took him up in his arms, praised God, and said,

>Now, Master,

>as you promised.  
>For my eyes have seen your salvation.  
>You have prepared it  
>in the presence of all peoples—  
>a light for revelation to the Gentiles  
>and glory to your people Israel.
>
>His father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.
