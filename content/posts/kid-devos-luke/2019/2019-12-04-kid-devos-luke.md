‚Äã				Luke 1:18‚Äì25 (CSB) ‚ÄúHow can I know this?‚Äù Zechariah asked the angel. ‚ÄúFor I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.‚Äù  The angel answered him, ‚ÄúI am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and tell you this good news.  Now listen. You will become silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.‚Äù  Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.  When he did come out, he could not speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making signs to them and remained speechless.  When the days of his ministry were completed, he went back home.  After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived and kept herself in seclusion for five months. She said,  ‚ÄúThe Lord has done this for me. He has looked with favor in these days to take away my disgrace among the people.‚Äù 

Matthew 7:21-23 Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?  And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.

I Chronicles 28:9 And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.

Romans 8:27 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
