My testimony, tentatively titled, "A Life of Compromise" will be written and uploaded in the weeks to come.  A memoir of a life being unprotected, unloved, and unwanted while being abused and raped all before the age of twelve. Furthermore, it is a witness of what happens when you don't get the help you needed and trying to navigate through love and relationships in the most disasterous ways. I hope, in my story, that you will see that God is the only one who redeems our past, makes right what went horrifically wrong, and how to go forward from here--no matter the world, others, nor Satan throws your way.
