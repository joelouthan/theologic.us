# Tuesday, November 8, 2020 Switching gears to just Psalmist Prayers

Late start to [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/joelouthan/projects). Which is okay because I don't write novels. But that is neither here nor there.

I have prepped for the next ten weeks (i.e. chapters) of Monday's [Commentary on Romans](/tags/commentary-romans/). But my confidence was a bit waning on even completing those ten weeks, which would have been about 20,000 words.

With that, I also wanted to make a hard dent into [Now Sings My Soul](/tags/now-sings-my-soul-psalms/). So I went to prepping for that. And prepping turned into writing. And writing into a filling up my heart with such joy and affections for my sweet Savior God.

I looked at the pace of which I write these prayers. In the beginning, I was writing a prayer per Psalm. But the more I read, the more I sat still. The more I dwelled on the Psalms, the more that each verse and idea starting to spring up more and more prayers. To be honest, each Psalm verse was generating a new prayer.

Then reality sets in. If I want to complete the project, how long would it take me?

There are 2,461 verses in the Psalms. Source: [Study.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjUvse7mvTsAhVNEawKHbDgCPkQFjACegQIBhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstudy.com%2Facademy%2Fanswer%2Fhow-many-verses-are-in-psalms.html&usg=AOvVaw3dUPM2mKGxYPzqrnEHvHIQ)

I have covered 53 verses thus far. That leaves me 2,408 verses to pray over. 

At my current rate, if I wrote one prayer per verse per week, this project would have taken me a little over 46 years.

But what if I wrote one prayer per day? Six and a half years

What about three per day? A little over two years.

So challenge accepted!

So I am going to use NaNoWriMo to make a hard, 90 chapter push into completing Now Sings My Soul.

I have put out 70 prayers. After this, month I will be 160 prayers in with over 2000 left to go.

To God be the glory alone.
