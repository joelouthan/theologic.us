# August 20, 2020 Pausing until September

Lots of changes in my own life. Taking an extended break from writing. Will pick up by September 8th.

# August 2, 2020 Shutting down Fridays and Saturdays
I am shutting down my social media for the next two months to pray.

Ergo, not a lot of content to repost if I am not on social media.

Praying for the church in next few months:

## Backbone of steel for the church

   **John 10:1-21 (ESV) “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.**
   
   **So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”**
   
   **There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?” Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”**

## Corruption to be exposed and promptly removed from the church

   **Matthew 3:12 (ESV) His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”**

## More laborers--more under-shephreds--to be brought into the church

   **Matthew 9:35–38 (ESV) And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”**
   
# Concerning under-shepherds and false shepherds

This falls under Jeremiah 23. This passage gripped my heart from 13 years ago when I got saved. I began reading the Bible for the first time as a believer and for whatever reason (perhaps the Spirit of God), I did not start with Genesis or Matthew but rather Jeremiah.

The 23rd chapter has been sitting on my heart since 2007. I don't know how God was going to do this but I know he will. I believe Jeremiah 23 and John 21 go hand-in-hand.

**Jeremiah 23:1–40 (ESV) “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.** 

**“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’** 

**“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’ but ‘As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.”** 

**Concerning the prophets:**

<b>

      My heart is broken within me; 
      all my bones shake; 
      I am like a drunken man, 
      like a man overcome by wine, 
      because of the LORD 
      and because of his holy words. 
      For the land is full of adulterers; 
      because of the curse the land mourns, 
      and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. 
      Their course is evil, 
      and their might is not right. 
      “Both prophet and priest are ungodly; 
      even in my house I have found their evil, 
                declares the LORD. 
      Therefore their way shall be to them 
      like slippery paths in the darkness, 
      into which they shall be driven and fall, 
      for I will bring disaster upon them 
      in the year of their punishment, 
                declares the LORD. 
      In the prophets of Samaria 
      I saw an unsavory thing: 
      they prophesied by Baal 
      and led my people Israel astray. 
      But in the prophets of Jerusalem 
      I have seen a horrible thing: 
      they commit adultery and walk in lies; 
      they strengthen the hands of evildoers, 
      so that no one turns from his evil; 
      all of them have become like Sodom to me, 
      and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.” 
      Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: 
      “Behold, I will feed them with bitter food 
      and give them poisoned water to drink, 
      for from the prophets of Jerusalem 
      ungodliness has gone out into all the land.” 

</b>

**Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, ‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No disaster shall come upon you.’ ”** 

<b>

      For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD 
      to see and to hear his word, 
      or who has paid attention to his word and listened? 
      Behold, the storm of the LORD! 
      Wrath has gone forth, 
      a whirling tempest; 
      it will burst upon the head of the wicked. 
      The anger of the LORD will not turn back 
      until he has executed and accomplished 
      the intents of his heart. 
      In the latter days you will understand it clearly. 

      “I did not send the prophets, 
      yet they ran; 
      I did not speak to them, 
      yet they prophesied. 
      But if they had stood in my council, 
      then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, 
      and they would have turned them from their evil way, 
      and from the evil of their deeds. 

</b>

**“Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD. I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart, who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another. Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, ‘declares the LORD.’ Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD.** 

**“When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD.’ And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ I will punish that man and his household. Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But ‘the burden of the LORD’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man’s own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God. Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have said these words, “The burden of the LORD,” when I sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ ” therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers. And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’ ”**

Now keep that in mind versus John 21:

**John 21:15–25 (ESV) When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.” (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, “Follow me.”** 

**Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?” When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!” So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”** 

**This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.** 

**Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.**

Pray these things. I will be praying as well.
