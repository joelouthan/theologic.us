## NaNoWriMo: How Did I Do?

### Sunday, December 13, 2020

Let's check the results:

```zsh
jlouthan@Ironhide  ~/bin/wc   master  cat wc_theo_totals
Week Of	    Total  Current Since
2020-11-02 1046072 51911  868292
2020-11-09 1080786 34714  903006
2020-11-16 1105046 24260  927266
2020-11-23 1185668 80622  1007888
2020-11-30 1232570 28952  1054790
```

According to my calculations, the number of words written for the month of November: 186,498.

Not too shabby.

Here's the kick: most of that is not in blog. Most of those words won't see the light of day. Most of those are my private, intimate moments with God.

And yet, essentially, I had my prayer journal within my blog--all with Draft status as `true`.  I felt as though I was playing with fire. I wouldn't know what to do if they accidentally published or somehow if Google was able to index it and made it available.

So I had to pull them out and put them into their own repo.

Which divides up the word count like so:

```zsh
====================================================
Week Of    Theo    Prayers  Total     Current Since
2020-12-10 325611  1176342  1501953   1176879 1324173
```

Index:

`Theo` - Total word count within my blog

`Prayers` - Total word count within my prayer journals

`Total` - Theo plus Prayers

`Current` - Total words written minus last weeks' total

`Since` - Total words written since migration to Hugo back in April 2020

What I am so deeply encouraged by is that for every four words written in prayer, one word is written on the blog. I like that a lot. It feels like I am on the right track.

I still need to keep punching on Prayers on the Psalms if I am going to finish within my lifetime.

Pray for me.
