**Hitting My Limit**

Right about the time I began the audacious task of writing two (2) commentaries at the same time and the untimely death of my brother, all of my writing stopped. I am still grieving over his loss (and thus why I am choosing to process my trauma in writing form). But I am admitting that I cannot write two commentaries at the same time.

So for the time being, I am going to hold of writing and posting Commentary on Mark and have removed it from the blog.

Here's the weekly focus:

Monday - Commentary on Romans<br>
Tuesday - Prayers according to the Psalms<br>
Wednesday - Memoir tentatively titled "A Life of Compromise"<br>
Thursday - Family Devotions in the Gospel of Luke<br>

**Working Through Past Trauma**

My testimony, tentatively titled, "A Life of Compromise" will be written and uploaded in the weeks to come.  A memoir of a life being unprotected, unloved, and unwanted while being abused and raped all before the age of twelve. Furthermore, it is a witness of what happens when you don't get the help you needed and trying to navigate through love and relationships in the most disasterous ways. I hope, in my story, that you will see that God is the only one who redeems our past, makes right what went horrifically wrong, and how to go forward from here--no matter the world, others, nor Satan throws your way.
