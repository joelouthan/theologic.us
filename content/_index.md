**Beta Testing**

Trying something out. Come back on Saturday.

**Keeping it chill**

I post Monday through Thursday. It always bothered me that I didn't have anything on Friday. I used to quote from the [Valley of Vision](https://banneroftruth.org/us/devotional-series/the-valley-of-vision-devotional/) (after realizing copying verbatium was a copyright violation.) It was nice but didn't feel the same. But I got this idea from [Nate Claiborne](http://nathanielclaiborne.com/sunday-seven-pizza-metal-billions/), who confessed he ripped the idea off from Tim Ferriss.  It goes to show that no idea is original.

For the sake of timing, I went ahead and posted my first one for May 1st: [Star Wars & Deadlifts Edition](https://theologic.us/five-point-friday/2020-05-01-five-point-friday/)

Here's now the weekly lineup:

Monday - Commentary on Romans<br>
Tuesday - Prayers according to the Psalms<br>
Wednesday - Memoir tentatively titled "A Life of Compromise"<br>
Thursday - Family Devotions in the Gospel of Luke<br>
Friday - Five Points

**Hitting My Limit**

Right about the time I began the audacious task of writing two (2) commentaries at the same time and the untimely death of my brother, all of my writing stopped. I am still grieving over his loss (and thus why I am choosing to process my trauma in writing form). But I am admitting that I cannot write two commentaries at the same time.

So for the time being, I am going to hold of writing and posting Commentary on Mark and have removed it from the blog.

Here's the weekly focus:

Monday - Commentary on Romans<br>
Tuesday - Prayers according to the Psalms<br>
Wednesday - Memoir tentatively titled "A Life of Compromise"<br>
Thursday - Family Devotions in the Gospel of Luke<br>

**Working Through Past Trauma**

My testimony, tentatively titled, "A Life of Compromise" will be written and uploaded in the weeks to come.  A memoir of a life being unprotected, unloved, and unwanted while being abused and raped all before the age of twelve. Furthermore, it is a witness of what happens when you don't get the help you needed and trying to navigate through love and relationships in the most disasterous ways. I hope, in my story, that you will see that God is the only one who redeems our past, makes right what went horrifically wrong, and how to go forward from here--no matter the world, others, nor Satan throws your way.
