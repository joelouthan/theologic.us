I wasn&#8217;t looking for God; yet, God ran after me.

God calls out to me and says, &#8220;Joseph, I love you. I have always loved you. I will always love you. You are mine and I am Yours forever.&#8221;

I turned in His direction.

With one breath, He motions to me and says, &#8220;C&#8217;mon, friend. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;

Now, I live.
