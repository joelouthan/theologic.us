I was really hoping that I can go two episodes Monday through Friday. I don't know why I thought I could do that with trying to move a second household cross country from Oklahoma to Kentucky.

I love getting stuff done and pushing myself to see what can be done. But when "git 'er dun" hits a dozen potholes, sometimes, you gotta tap the brakes.

Here's what is going to happen:

- **Back to weekday Morning Devotions** - This can be done easily despite the moving chaos going on.

- **Pulling new evening episodes offline** - I was so excited about continuing the Romans, Genesis, and Pastoral series as well as firing up the Daniel and Westminster series. But as you can imagine, the prep and the recording for those episodes takes a lot more time and effort. I do have a couple episodes started for 2022 but by the time I get to Kentucky, get settled and get setup, it might be 2-3 months. For the sake of clarity and consistency, I am going to pull new episodes non-Home Devotions, reprep, restack, reload, and relaunching.

Right now, I am setting my sights on relaunching on Easter, April 17th.

Thanks for hanging in there. Pray for me and my family. God be praised.
